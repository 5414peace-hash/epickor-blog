Seoul is one of the safest cities in the world, but like any global mega-city, it has its own set of "hidden rules" and minor traps that can catch tourists off guard. To travel like a pro and avoid unnecessary stress, you need to know about the two types of taxi scams, the "Silent Subway" rule, and the street-level recruiters.

### 1. Watch Out for the 'Black Taxis' and Overcharging
While most Korean taxi drivers are honest, there are a few bad apples.
- **The Scam:** Some drivers near tourist hubs (like Myeongdong or Incheon Airport) might try to charge a flat, high fee instead of using the meter. 
- **The Solution:** Always ensure the meter is running. If you feel the fare is suspiciously high, take a photo of the driver's ID (displayed on the dashboard) and ask for a receipt. Koreans hate these scams and will help you report them to the "1330 Korea Travel Hotline."

### 2. The Rush Hour 'Silent Carpool'
If you enter a Seoul subway during rush hour, you might think you've entered a silent library. Hundreds of people in dark clothes will be standing shoulder-to-shoulder, completely silent.
- **The Manners:** Talking loudly or laughing on your phone during this time is considered a major breach of etiquette. You will get "the look" from everyone around you. Treat the rush-hour subway as a silent carpool where everyone is just trying to get home in peace.

### 3. The "Excuse Me~" Street Trap
If a stranger approaches you on the street (often a pair of polite-looking young people) and starts with "Excuse me, can I talk to you about Korean culture?" or "You have a good energy," keep walking.
- **The Reality:** 99% of the time, these are recruiters for religious cults or people asking for "donations" for fake ceremonies. They are harmless but very persistent. A polite "No thank you" and continued walking is the best response.

### 4. FAQ: Safety Tips
**Q: Is it safe to walk alone at night?**
A: **Yes.** Seoul is extremely safe, and you can walk through almost any district at 3 AM without fear.
**Q: What should I do if I lose my wallet?**
A: Go to the nearest police box (CCTV is everywhere). Also, check the **LOST112** website—Korea's massive nationwide lost and found database.
