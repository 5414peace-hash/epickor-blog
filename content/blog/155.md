Forget the boring museum souvenirs of the past. In Korea, the **National Museum of Korea (NMK)** has become a trendsetter among Gen Z, thanks to its brilliant lifestyle brand, **MU:DS (뮷즈)**. By reinterpreting ancient treasures into high-quality, aesthetic items, the museum has created a "Goods Craze" where products sell out within minutes of being released.

### 1. The Star of the Show: The Pensive Bodhisattva Miniature
The most iconic "MU:DS" item is the miniature of the **Gilt-bronze Pensive Bodhisattva**. This 6th-century masterpiece, known for its serene smile, has been transformed into a variety of colorful, palm-sized figurines. Even BTS's RM is a fan, making these miniatures a "Must-Have" for both locals and global fans.

MU:DS isn't just about figurines. They offer a range of products that blend seamlessly into modern life:
- **Mother-of-Pearl Coasters:** Reinterpreting traditional 'Najeonchilgi' techniques.
- **Celadon Ceramics:** Using the iconic Goryeo Celadon green for modern plates and cups.
