# Discover Korea's Diverse Beverage Culture Beyond Soju

While `traveling in Korea`, you can drink purified `water for free` in many places, but you can't just drink water, right? It is said that Koreans drink a drink called ‘`Soju`’. 

Right, the alcohol that Koreans consume the most is ‘Soju.’ 

While there are sojus sold nationwide, such as ‘`Jinro`’ and ‘`Chamisul`’, there is also soju sold only in regions such as ‘`Hallasan`’ in Jeju Island and ‘`Daeseon`’ in Busan.

### Korean Beer

**Korean Beer and Its Criticism**:

It's not a big deal, but Korean beer has often been criticized for being tasteless. 

Of course, not many Koreans claim that Korean beer is really delicious. 

But… Somaek is delicious.
