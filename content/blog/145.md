**Naengmyeon** (Cold Buckwheat Noodles) is perhaps Korea's most unique culinary contribution. While most cultures serve noodles hot, Koreans have mastered the art of noodles in a freezing, icy broth. Originally a winter delicacy from the north, it has become the ultimate "heat-killer" for the hot Korean summer.

### 1. The Great Divide: P-Neng vs. H-Neng
There are two major styles of Naengmyeon, named after North Korean cities:
- **Pyongyang Naengmyeon (P-Neng):** Served in a cold beef broth. The taste is famously "bland" (pyeong-pyae) and subtle. Fans say the more you eat it, the more you fall in love with its deep, hidden flavor.
- **Hamhung Naengmyeon (H-Neng):** Served with a spicy, red gochujang-based sauce (Bibim). The noodles are made from potato or sweet potato starch, making them incredibly chewy and "rubbery" in a good way.

### 2. The Art of the 'Scissors'
Because the noodles are so long and chewy (symbolizing longevity), the server will often ask if you want them cut with scissors. Purists of Pyongyang style say you should never cut the noodles, as it ruins the texture. 

### 3. The Science of Vinegar and Mustard
You will always find vinegar and hot mustard on the table. A dash of vinegar adds acidity to cut through the beef fat, while mustard adds a kick that clears the sinuses. It’s a DIY flavor experiment in every bowl!

### FAQ: How to Eat Like a Pro
**Q: Should I drink the broth first?**
A: Yes! Take a big sip of the cold broth before you mix anything. It’s the best way to appreciate the chef's hard work on the soup base.
**Q: Is it only for summer?**
A: Historically, it was a winter dish! The icy broth was made from dongchimi (radish water kimchi) kept in the ground. Today, it’s a year-round favorite.
