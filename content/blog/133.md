If you want to understand the "digital soul" of Korea, you have to visit a **PC Bang** (PC Room). It is much more than an internet cafe; it is a cultural institution where the world's best gamers are born, and where modern Korean youth come to socialize, eat, and relax in a high-tech oasis.

### 1. Not Your Average Computer Lab
A modern Korean PC Bang features rows of high-end gaming PCs with RTX 40-series graphics cards, massive 144Hz monitors, and mechanical keyboards. The chairs are oversized, ergonomic recliners that feel like first-class airplane seats. 
- **The Speed:** Korea’s internet is famous for being the fastest in the world, and PC Bangs have dedicated lines that ensure zero lag for competitive games like *League of Legends* or *VALORANT*.

### 2. Gourmet Food Delivered to Your Desk
The real "game-changer" in PC Bang culture is the food. You don't just eat cup ramen. Most PC Bangs have a full kitchen. With a few clicks on your screen, you can order:
- **Tteokbokki and Fried Chicken**
- **Iced Americanos and Fresh Lemonade**
- **Handmade Hamburgers and Pasta**
The food is delivered directly to your desk by staff so you never have to stop your gaming session.

### 3. The Social Aspect: "The Gaming Neighborhood"
Contrary to the stereotype of the lonely gamer, PC Bangs are highly social. Groups of friends go together to "Duo" or "Squad" up in games. It is a safe, 24/7 space that is affordable (usually around $1 per hour), making it the ultimate hangout spot for students and office workers alike.

### FAQ: Visiting a PC Bang
**Q: Can foreigners use PC Bangs?**
A: Yes! Most have a kiosk at the entrance. You might need to ask for help to register as a "Non-Member," but the staff are usually very helpful.
**Q: Is it okay for non-gamers?**
A: Definitely. Many people use PC Bangs to watch YouTube, Netflix, or even finish some urgent office work in a comfortable environment with great food.
