If you've watched the viral Netflix hit *Culinary Class Wars* (Heukbaek-Yorisa), you know the name **Sung-jae Ahn**. As the only chef in Korea to hold three Michelin stars for his restaurant **Mosu**, he has become the face of modern Korean fine dining. His obsession with "Ingredient Integrity" and "Perfect Cooking" has set a new global standard.

### 1. Mosu: The Innovation of Memory
Mosu isn't just about expensive ingredients; it’s about memory. Chef Ahn takes traditional Korean flavors and recreates them with world-class French and Japanese techniques. His famous "Abalone Taco" is a perfect example of his ability to blend global textures with local seafood.

### 2. The "Perfectly Cooked Vegetable"
During *Culinary Class Wars*, Chef Ahn became famous for his strict judgment on how vegetables were cooked. For him, a millimeter of difference in texture is the difference between "Good" and "Perfect." This level of discipline is what earned him the rare 3-star rating.

Thanks to Chef Ahn's influence, Seoul is being recognized as a global culinary capital. He has shown that Korean food is not just about BBQ and Kimchi; it is a sophisticated, evolving language of flavor that deserves a place on the world's most prestigious tables.
