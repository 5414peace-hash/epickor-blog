# Discover the Must-Have K-Beauty Products at Olive Young in Korea

If your country has `Sephora`, Korea has `Olive Young`. 

So what should you buy at Olive Young when you are in Korea?

### Mask Pack

In Korea, mask packs have become so popular that many people use one pack a day, and you can buy products with good functionality at a low price. 

Keep in mind that there are regular sales around the end of each month, so you can buy items at really cheap prices. If there are too many mask packs and you don’t know what to choose, I recommend “`Mediheal`” and “`Abib`” Mask Pack. It's good value for money. 

Of course, it's not an advertisement.

### Basic Cosmetics

If you have come to Korea, it would be a good idea to buy products from brands that are only available in Korea. There are many mild and good basic products that can be effective for many people with various skin types. 

For example, Round Lab’s `Dokdo toner` is also famous among Koreans.

And we also recommend Korean brands such as `Hanyul`, `CNP`, `Goodal`, `Dr. G`, and `Torriden`.
