# It's a Korean DNA Thing

There are Korean people `smiling and clapping` at the same time. 

Why? 

Why do Koreans always clap when they laugh?

### Automatic Reflex

In fact, even Koreans don’t know the reason. And of course, me either. I don’t think there’s any particular reason. Maybe it’s just an automatic reflex or something.

### Sensitive to Reactions

Some people say this is because Koreans tend to react sensitively to other people’s reactions. That's why applause shows "I'm well integrated into this conversation."

### Body Reacting

But actually, it's just the body reacting without thinking. Others say that you act out loud to elicit a reaction from the other person and make the other laugh too.

### Laugh Together

Hmm. Maybe it could be true. When someone laughs in front of me, I usually laugh too. But, again, I think it's just the body reacting with high probability. Believe me.

### Health Benefits

Anyway, laughing with clapping produces natural painkillers in the brain and improves memory. So maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to try it.
