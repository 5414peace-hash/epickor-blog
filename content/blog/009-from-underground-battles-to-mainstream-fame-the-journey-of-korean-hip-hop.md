# The Evolution of Korean Hip-Hop: Part 2

### The Debate Between Underground and Overground

The Korean hip-hop scene has been divided between underground rappers and overground (commercial singers), leading to a long-standing debate over who is truly hip-hop and who is not. 

Eventually, with the advent of the ‘`SHOW ME THE MONEY`’ TV program, everyone, regardless of whether it was underground or overground, chose to appear on this program to make money and become famous.

At that time, the popularity of hip-hop music in Korea was so high that there was even a saying, “There were about a million hip-hop fans, but there were a million rappers.”

### The Decline

However, the 11 seasons ultimately ended with the victory of female rapper ‘`Lee Young-ji`’. 

PDs also abandoned the elements of hip-hop, which were no longer stimulating and fun. 

As a result, the 11-year-long program concluded, and the popularity of hip-hop music weakened compared to the past.
