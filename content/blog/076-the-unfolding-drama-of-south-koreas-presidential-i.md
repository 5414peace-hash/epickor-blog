### Key Events: What Happened?

**Martial Law Declared**:

On `December 3, 2024`, at precisely 10:28 PM, President Yoon shocked the nation by declaring martial law. The announcement came amidst heightened political tensions, with the government citing severe disruptions caused by the opposition's budget cuts and allegations of electoral fraud.

**Martial Law Lifted**:

In an unprecedented turn of events, the National Assembly acted swiftly, voting at 1:01 AM on `December 4` to demand the lifting of martial law. By 4:28 AM, just hours after it began, President Yoon officially revoked the order.

**The Fallout**:

The declaration and abrupt reversal of martial law only fueled public and political outrage. Accusations of abuse of power and chaos creation emerged, leading to calls for impeachment from both opposition leaders and some members of the ruling party.

### The Reasons Behind Martial Law

President Yoon justified his controversial decision by pointing to a government deadlock allegedly orchestrated by the opposition party. He accused them of slashing critical budgets and propagating baseless claims of election fraud. The declaration of martial law, according to Yoon, was a last-resort measure to stabilize the nation.

However, critics argue that these actions only deepened the crisis, undermining public trust in his leadership and the broader political system.
