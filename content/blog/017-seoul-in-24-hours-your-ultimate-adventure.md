# Discover the Hidden Gems and Culinary Delights of Seoul in Just One Day

Forget about Myeongdong, Gwanghwamun, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. 

The food and places we are introducing from now on are `hidden gems` that have never been introduced anywhere before, so subscribe, save, and keep it.

### Mountain Retreats

There are many mountains in Seoul, and in the mountains, there are `streams`. 

Near these streams, you can find restaurants where you can eat `samgyetang` (chicken soup) while dipping your feet in the cool water.

Actually, the address is not Seoul, but still very close. Namhansanseong Fortress, located in southeastern Seoul, is home to numerous samgyetang restaurants along the streams. 

A glass of makgeolli, a traditional Korean drink, and chicken soup, then enjoy an unforgettable vacation by dipping your feet in cool streams and forests.

### Did you know that Seoul is a delivery paradise?

No matter where you are, food delivery comes to you via GPS. 

Take a taxi and go to `Hangang Park`. 

Then find a suitable place and order chicken and beer. 

If you're savoring chicken and beer as the sun sets over the river, accompanied by a cool breeze, it's a clear sign that you're already relishing a delightful vacation.
