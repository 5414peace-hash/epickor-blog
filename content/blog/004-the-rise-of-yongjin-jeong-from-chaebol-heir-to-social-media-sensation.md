### Chaebol Definition

---

---

In Korea, there is a term called `‘Chaebol’` that refers to family-run conglomerates with massive wealth, often passed down through generations. These companies typically have assets exceeding 10 trillion won and are led by 'silver spoon' heirs who inherit both wealth and management rights.

### Breaking Tradition

Second and third-generation chaebols usually refrain from making political statements or disclosing personal details, considering Korean cultural norms and sentiments. However, Yongjin Jeong stands out as an exception to this rule.

### Myeolgong Controversy

Yongjin Jeong became widely known for his ‘`myeolgong멸공`’ statement, an abbreviation for ‘Destroy the Communists,’ which refers to the perceived main enemy of South Korea’s liberal democracy. By posting #myeolgong멸공 on his social media, he publicly showcased his right-wing political views, stirring considerable public interest and debate.
