# Discover Rural Korea - Choncance

In Korea, there's a term called '`choncance`.' It comes from combining '`chon`,' a Korean word that means countryside, and '`cance`' from 'vacance' (vacation).

### Peaceful Retreat

It's like when people tired of city life head to the countryside for some peace and quiet.

### Traditional Experience

Imagine grilling pork belly on a pot lid in a traditional Korean mud house or an old countryside house. It’s a whole different taste experience compared to eating at a restaurant.

### Authentic Vibe

### Relaxing Surroundings

These country-style lodgings are usually great for relaxing because they’re surrounded by grass, nestled in the mountains, or in quiet, secluded spots.
