The **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** is a 250km-long strip of land that separates North and South Korea. It is paradoxical: the most heavily fortified border in the world, yet a place of serene natural beauty and a symbol of the hope for reunification. For many travelers, a visit to the DMZ is a sobering reminder of the Cold War's living legacy.

### 1. The JSA: Standing Face-to-Face
The **Joint Security Area (JSA)** in Panmunjom is the only place where soldiers from both sides stand face-to-face. You can actually step across the border into North Korean territory inside the blue UN buildings. It is a place of extreme tension and strict protocol.

### 2. The Third Tunnel: A Secret Invasion Route
Discovered in 1978, the **Third Infiltration Tunnel** was dug by North Korea to launch a surprise attack on Seoul. Visitors can walk 73 meters underground into the narrow tunnel. It’s a claustrophobic but powerful experience that shows the reality of the ongoing conflict.

### 3. The Paradoxical Sanctuary
Because humans have been barred from the DMZ for over 70 years, it has unintentionally become one of the most pristine wildlife sanctuaries in the world. Endangered species like the Red-crowned Crane and the Asiatic Black Bear thrive in the untouched forests and wetlands between the barbed wire.

### FAQ: Visiting the DMZ
**Q: Is it safe for tourists?**
A: Yes. The DMZ is highly regulated. You must go with an authorized tour group and bring your passport. 
**Q: Can I see North Koreans?**
A: From the **Dora Observatory**, you can see "Propaganda Village" (Kijong-dong) and sometimes see farmers working in the fields through high-powered telescopes.
