# Why Are Koreans Crazy About Garlic

### The Love for Garlic in Korea

BBC MasterChef's main host, `John Torode`, once remarked that he ate more `garlic` during his visit to Korea than he had in his entire life. 

He even showed a handful of garlic, explaining that what Koreans consider "a little" is actually quite a lot.

In fact, Korean per capita annual garlic consumption ranks first in the world. This country even cultivates “elephant garlic,” which is 10 times larger than regular garlic.

### The Mythical Origins

But when did Koreans start their love affair with garlic? 

According to a famous Korean myth, a long time ago, a god from the sky descended to the human world. A bear and a tiger asked this god to make them human. The god told them they could become human if they survived 100 days in a cave eating only mugwort and garlic. Only the bear succeeded and became human.

### Dangun: The Garlic Connection

The bear-turned-human married the god and had a son, `Dangun`, who is considered the ancestor of Koreans. Thus, the joke is that Koreans started as a people of garlic from the very beginning with Dangun.
