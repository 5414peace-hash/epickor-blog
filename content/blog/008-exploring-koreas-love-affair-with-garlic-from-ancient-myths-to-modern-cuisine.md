## "A Little Bit of Garlic"
When a Korean recipe says to add "a little bit of garlic," it usually means a massive, overflowing tablespoon of minced cloves. To a Western chef, this might seem like a mistake. To a Korean, it’s just the beginning.

BBC MasterChef host **John Torode** once remarked that he ate more garlic during his short trip to Korea than he had in his entire life. He wasn't exaggerating. Per capita, South Koreans consume about **6.2 kg (13 lbs) of garlic per year**. For comparison, the average American eats less than 1 kg.

Why are Koreans so obsessed with this pungent bulb? It’s more than just flavor; it’s a matter of mythology, health, and national identity.

### 1. The Mythological Origin: The Bear and the Garlic
The love for garlic is literally written into the Korean creation myth. 
* **The Story:** Long ago, a bear and a tiger wanted to become human. They prayed to the son of the Lord of Heaven, who gave them a challenge: live in a dark cave for 100 days eating only 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort. 
* **The Outcome:** The tiger gave up after a few days. The bear persisted, eating the garlic and mugwort, and on the 21st day, she transformed into a beautiful woman (Ungnyeo). She then married the god and gave birth to Dangun, the founder of the first Korean kingdom.
* **The Logic:** Koreans jokingly say they eat so much garlic to make sure they don't turn back into bears. It is the food that made them human.

### 2. Garlic as a Base, Not a Garnish
In Western cooking, garlic is often used to infuse oil or as a subtle background note. In Korea, it is a primary ingredient.
* **The Foundation of Flavor:** Garlic is one of the "Holy Trinity" of Korean aromatics, along with ginger and green onions. It is the base for almost every soup, stew, and marinade.
* **Raw Power:** Koreans are one of the few cultures that regularly eat large amounts of raw garlic. Whether it's wrapped in a lettuce leaf with grilled pork (Samgyeopsal) or sliced thin in a salad, the raw punch of garlic is a prized flavor profile.

### 3. The Health Halo
Koreans view food as medicine (Yak-sik-dong-won). Garlic is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.
* **Natural Antibiotic:** During the SARS and COVID-19 outbreaks, there was a widespread (though unproven) belief in Korea that the high consumption of garlic and Kimchi helped protect the population.
* **Energy Booster:** In traditional Korean medicine, garlic is believed to increase "stamina" and "vitality," making it a favorite for those doing physically demanding work.

### 4. The Garlic Evolution
Today, Korea is finding new ways to eat garlic. 
* **Black Garlic:** Fermented at high temperatures, black garlic is sweet, syrupy, and packed with even more antioxidants. 
* **Garlic Everything:** From garlic-flavored ice cream to the famous "Cream Cheese Garlic Bread" that went viral globally, Koreans are constantly pushing the boundaries of how much garlic one person can consume.

### Conclusion: The Scent of Home
For many Koreans living abroad, the smell of garlic sautéing in a pan is the smell of home. It is the invisible thread that connects a modern K-pop star to an ancient bear in a cave. If you want to understand the Korean palate, you have to embrace the garlic. Just make sure to bring some mints for afterward.
