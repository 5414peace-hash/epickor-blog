# Korean Travel Destinations Loved by Koreans

When you feel like `going to Korea`, where do you think you should go? 

It seems that many people choose Seoul as their travel destination to climb Namsan Tower, see Gyeongbokgung Palace, or visit Myeong-dong. 

However, since more than 20% of the Korean population is concentrated in one city, Seoul, Koreans actually like to travel `outside of Seoul`. 

### Jeju Island

So, where do many Koreans go to travel? According to actual tourism statistics in Korea, many people go to Jeju Island, an island with a unique and beautiful natural scenery.
