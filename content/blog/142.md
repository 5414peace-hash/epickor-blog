In South Korea, the military is not just an organization; it is a shared cultural experience that defines the lives of almost all men. Recently, the global spotlight has been on this system as the members of **BTS** began their mandatory service. Understanding this system is key to understanding the Korean psyche and the concept of "National Duty."

### 1. The Mandatory Reality
Due to the ongoing tension with North Korea, all able-bodied South Korean men must serve in the military for 18 to 21 months. It is seen as a "Rite of Passage." Men often put their careers, education, and even their youth on hold to fulfill this duty.

### 2. The BTS Impact: Fairness Over Fame
There was a massive global debate about whether BTS should be exempted from service. However, in Korea, "Fairness" is a core social value. By choosing to serve, BTS members like **Jin** and **J-Hope** earned even more respect from the Korean public. They showed that no matter how famous you are, you are first a citizen of Korea.

### 3. Life After Service
Military service creates a unique bond between Korean men. You will often hear men in their 40s and 50s still talking about their "Military Days" (*Gundaeryeok*). It instills a sense of discipline and "Can-Do" spirit that has been a major factor in Korea's rapid economic development.
