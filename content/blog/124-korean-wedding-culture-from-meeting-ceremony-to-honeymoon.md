## The Meeting Ceremony (맞선, Matchun)

Before a couple gets married in Korea, there's often a formal meeting between the two families. This tradition, known as **맞선 (Matchun)** or the "meeting ceremony," serves as an important first step in the marriage process.

### Purpose and Significance

The meeting ceremony is more than just an introduction—it's a way for both families to assess compatibility and discuss important matters. During this gathering, parents from both sides meet to:

- Get to know each other's family background
- Discuss the couple's future plans
- Establish a foundation for the relationship between the two families
- Share expectations and values

This tradition reflects the Korean belief that marriage is not just between two individuals, but between two families. The meeting helps ensure that both families are comfortable with the union and can support the couple moving forward.

## The Modern Korean Wedding Ceremony

Most Korean weddings today follow a Western-style format, held in wedding halls or hotels. The ceremony typically includes:

- **The Bride's Entrance**: The bride walks down the aisle, often accompanied by her father
- **Exchange of Vows**: The couple makes promises to each other
- **Ring Exchange**: Wedding rings are exchanged as symbols of commitment
- **The Kiss**: A brief kiss to seal the marriage (often quite modest by Western standards)

However, what makes Korean weddings truly unique is what comes after the main ceremony—the **Pyebaek** ritual.

## Pyebaek (폐백): The Traditional Korean Wedding Ritual

**Pyebaek** is a private, traditional Korean ceremony that takes place after the main wedding. This intimate ritual is one of the most meaningful parts of a Korean wedding, as it represents the bride's formal introduction to her new family.

During the Pyebaek ceremony:

1. **Traditional Attire**: The bride and groom change into traditional Korean wedding hanbok (한복). The bride typically wears a colorful jeogori (jacket) and chima (skirt), while the groom wears a hanbok with a special hat.
2. **Deep Bows**: The couple performs deep traditional bows (큰절, keun-jeol) to the groom's parents and elder relatives. This gesture shows respect and gratitude.
3. **Receiving Blessings**: The elders offer words of wisdom, blessings, and advice for the couple's future life together.
4. **Jujube and Chestnut Toss**: In a playful tradition, the groom's parents toss jujubes (대추, daechu) and chestnuts (밤, bam) at the bride, who tries to catch them in her skirt. The number caught is said to predict how many children the couple will have!

### Why Pyebaek Matters

Pyebaek is deeply rooted in Confucian values of filial piety and respect for elders. It symbolizes:

- The bride's acceptance into her new family
- The couple's commitment to honoring their parents
- The continuation of family traditions
- The blending of two family lines

## The Symbolic Mandarin Ducks (원앙, Won-ang)

One of the most charming symbols in Korean wedding culture is the **mandarin duck** (원앙, won-ang). These beautiful birds are often featured in Korean weddings because they mate for life, making them a perfect representation of marital fidelity and harmony.

### Mandarin Ducks in Korean Weddings

You'll often see mandarin duck imagery or figurines at Korean weddings:

- **Wedding Decorations**: Wooden or ceramic duck pairs are displayed at the ceremony
- **Wedding Gifts**: Mandarin duck sets are popular wedding presents
- **Symbolism**: They represent a loving, faithful, and harmonious marriage

The tradition comes from the observation that mandarin ducks stay together throughout their lives, swimming side by side and caring for each other—qualities that are highly valued in Korean marriages.

## Wedding Gift Customs

Gift-giving at Korean weddings follows specific customs that differ from Western traditions:

### Money Envelopes (축의금, Chuk-ui-geum)

The most common wedding gift in Korea is cash, presented in a special white envelope called **축의금 (chuk-ui-geum)**. Here's what you need to know:

- **Amount**: Typically ranges from 50,000 to 100,000 won (approximately $40-$80 USD), depending on your relationship with the couple
- **Presentation**: The money is placed in a white envelope with your name written on it
- **Guest Book**: You write your name and the amount in a guest book when you arrive
- **Purpose**: This practical gift helps the couple with wedding expenses and starting their new life together

### Why Cash?

Korean weddings often have large guest lists (sometimes 200-300 people or more), and cash gifts are the most practical way to help the couple. The money is carefully recorded so the couple knows exactly who gave what amount—this is important for reciprocating when those guests have their own family events in the future.

Korean wedding receptions are typically more casual than Western ones:

- **Buffet Style**: Most receptions feature a buffet meal rather than a sit-down dinner
- **Quick Duration**: Receptions are usually shorter, lasting about an hour
- **Casual Atmosphere**: Guests often eat quickly and leave, as multiple wedding ceremonies may be scheduled in the same venue on the same day
- **Photo Time**: There's usually a designated time for guests to take photos with the couple

## The Honeymoon

Korean couples take their honeymoons seriously! Popular honeymoon destinations include:

### Domestic Destinations

- **Busan**: Coastal city with beaches and cultural sites

### International Destinations

- **Southeast Asia**: Thailand, Vietnam, Bali

Many Korean couples save up for elaborate honeymoons, viewing it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel together before settling into married life.
