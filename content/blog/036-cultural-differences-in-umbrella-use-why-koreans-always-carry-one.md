# An Umbrella on a Rainy Day

Do you use an umbrella when it rains? Or do you just get caught in the rain?

If you're Korean, you're probably using an `umbrella`.

In fact, in the past, a newspaper asked American citizens whether they took an umbrella on a rainy day. 66% of respondents said they would never take one, saying it was good to have both hands free.

### Climatic Differences

However, in fact, it seems that this difference appears due to the characteristics of the climatic environment. When it rains in Korea, it often comes down in `heavy rain` all at once.

### Other Countries

However, in many other countries, there are many places where it only rains a little and it stops quickly, so umbrellas are often considered a troublesome item.

### Health Perception

Additionally, Koreans have the perception that rain means that polluted substances are washed away, so getting exposed to rain is not good for health.

Of course, there are many reasons for every phenomenon, but in any case, Koreans always carry an umbrella on rainy days. 

### What about you?

If it's going to rain, do you always take an `umbrella`?

> Understanding the cultural differences in umbrella use highlights how environmental factors and health perceptions influence daily habits. In Korea, heavy rains and concerns about pollution make umbrellas a necessity. Contrastingly, in other countries, lighter rains and the desire for convenience lead to different practices. Next time it rains, consider the reasons behind why you do or don’t use an umbrella.
