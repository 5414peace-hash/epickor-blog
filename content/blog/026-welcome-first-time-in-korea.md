### Eyeglasses Story

For example, in this program, there was a scene where foreigners went to a Korean optical store and were very surprised at how quickly the glasses were produced. In Korea, eyeglasses are usually made in as little as `15 minutes`.

### Cultural Differences

However, since Koreans are already used to that speed, they were rather surprised to see foreigners surprised by that speed. And foreigners living in Korea sympathized with the surprised faces of the travelers.

### Recommendation

So I recommend it because you can get advance information about things that might surprise you when you visit Korea, such as “`Oh, what’s wrong with this?`” or “`Wow, there is a place like this in Korea.`”
