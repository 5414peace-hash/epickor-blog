# Discover the Authentic Travel Experiences of Foreigners in Korea

Are you very interested in `Korea`? 

Do you have any plans to travel to Korea? 

Then you should watch this `Korean TV show`, not Running Man.

### "Welcome, First Time in Korea?"

The title, “Welcome, First Time in Korea?” shows the realistic travel stories of foreigners from various countries in Korea. Travelers who come to Korea for the first time react honestly to cultural differences and foods they encounter for the first time.

### Surprising Moments

When Koreans see foreigners being amazed about Korea, Koreans think, 

`“Is that amazing?”` 

And when foreigners watch the show, they have a moment of surprise and say, 

`“Wow, Korea is like that?”`

### Eyeglasses Story

For example, in this program, there was a scene where foreigners went to a Korean optical store and were very surprised at how quickly the glasses were produced. In Korea, eyeglasses are usually made in as little as `15 minutes`.

### Cultural Differences

However, since Koreans are already used to that speed, they were rather surprised to see foreigners surprised by that speed. And foreigners living in Korea sympathized with the surprised faces of the travelers.

### Recommendation

So I recommend it because you can get advance information about things that might surprise you when you visit Korea, such as “`Oh, what’s wrong with this?`” or “`Wow, there is a place like this in Korea.`”
