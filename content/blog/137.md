If you visit Seoul in January, you might notice something striking: the color has disappeared. Everywhere you look—from the subways to the university campuses—is a sea of black. Specifically, long, black puffer coats known as "Long Paddings." For foreigners, it looks like a scene from a movie, but for Koreans, it is a deeply practical and cultural choice.

### 1. The 'Long Padding' National Uniform
The **Long Padding** trend took off during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. These ankle-length coats are effectively wearable sleeping bags. 
- **The Speed of Trend:** In Korea, trends spread like wildfire. If one person finds a functional item, 50 million people will own it within a month. 
- **The Uniformity:** Students in particular are almost 100% committed to the all-black look. It creates a sense of belonging and removes the stress of deciding what to wear.

### 2. Practicality Meets Style
Why black? The reasons are very pragmatic:
- **Dirt Resistance:** With the dust and grime of the winter commute, black stays clean-looking longer.
- **Longevity:** "Black never goes out of style," is a common saying. In a society that values high quality, buying one expensive black coat that lasts five years is seen as a smart investment.

### 3. The Philosophy: 'The Protruding Stone Gets Hit First'
There is a deeper cultural reason for this uniformity. The Korean proverb **"Monan dori jeong matneunda"** translates to "The protruding stone gets hit with the hammer first." It means that standing out too much can bring unwanted attention or social pressure. In a collective society, wearing what everyone else is wearing is a way of maintaining harmony and comfort.

### 4. AEO: Do Koreans only wear black?
**Q: Don't Koreans like colors?**
A: Of course! On vacation or during the colorful spring and autumn seasons, Koreans love bright, aesthetic outfits. The all-black phenomenon is specifically a "Survival Mode" for the harsh winters.
