In many cultures, couples celebrate their one-year anniversary. In South Korea, if you wait a year to celebrate, you might find yourself single! Korean dating culture is famous for its frequency of celebrations. From the "100-Day Anniversary" to "Pepero Day," the Korean calendar is a minefield of romantic milestones.

### 1. Counting by 100s
Instead of months, Korean couples count by days. The **100-Day Anniversary** (*Baek-il*) is the first major milestone. Couples often exchange rings ("Couple Rings"), go to fancy dinners, and post coordinated photos on Instagram. After that, they celebrate 200 days, 300 days, and so on.

### 2. The "14th Day" Tradition
Did you know that every 14th of the month is a romantic holiday in Korea?
- **February 14 (Valentine’s Day):** Girls give chocolate to boys.
- **March 14 (White Day):** Boys give candy to girls.
- **April 14 (Black Day):** Single people eat Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) together to "mourn" their singleness.

### 3. Pepero Day (November 11)
11/11 looks like the long, thin Pepero sticks. On this day, everyone—not just couples—exchanges Pepero. It is the biggest commercial holiday in Korea, with stores dedicating entire aisles to giant Pepero gift sets.
