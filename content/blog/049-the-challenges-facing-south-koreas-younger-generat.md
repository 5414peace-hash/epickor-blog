### Hell Joseon

**Origin and Meaning**:

It is a combination of hell and Joseon, the old name of Korea. 

The term 'Hell Joseon' is a mocking term coined by the younger generation, directed towards Koreans over the age of 55. It's a jab at those who, if they had persevered and worked hard when they were younger, could have owned a house and supported their families. This term is known as 'Hell Joseon.’

### Younger Generation's Perspective

**Marriage and Family**:

The younger generation in Korea does `not get married` or `have children`.

### Rethinking Priorities

**Personal Happiness vs. Societal Expectations**:

But if you really think about it, why should they? 

For what? For the country and its people? Or for their own happiness?
