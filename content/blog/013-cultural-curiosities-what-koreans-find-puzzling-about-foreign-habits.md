# Things Koreans DON’T Understand

**What Koreans think when they see foreigners.**

**People around the world have these questions about Koreans.**

- **Why sit on the floor even there is a sofa?**

- **Why do they clap or hit others when they laugh?**

- **Why do people leave things carelessly everywhere and why don't they steal from each other?**

- **But why only steal a bicycle?**

### Floor Seating

**Why `sit on the floor` even when there's a sofa?**
Koreans often prefer sitting on the floor, even if there is a sofa available. 

This practice is deeply rooted in their traditional lifestyle and cultural values.

### Expressive Reactions

**Why `clap or hit` others when laughing?**
It’s common in Korea for people to clap or lightly hit someone nearby when they laugh. This behavior is a natural expression of joy and excitement, creating a shared moment of happiness.

### Trust in Community

**Why do people leave things carelessly everywhere and not steal from each other?**
Korean society values trust and community. It’s common to see personal belongings left unattended because there is a strong cultural norm against stealing.

**But why only `steal a bicycle`?**
However, bicycles are an exception, possibly due to their high utility and ease of resale.

### Shoes on the Bed

**Putting shoes on and getting on the bed**
Koreans take off their shoes when entering a room. Beds and sofas are seen as places for rest, requiring cleanliness. The idea of climbing on these furniture pieces with dirty shoes is unimaginable.

### Small Talk

**Too much small talk**
In Korea, small talk is reserved for close friends. In contrast, foreign cultures often engage in small talk even with strangers, like waiters asking about your day or the weather.

### Tipping Culture

**Tipping culture**
In Korea, the cost of food typically includes the service fee. Paying additional taxes and then `tipping` the waiter is a foreign concept that many Koreans find hard to understand.
