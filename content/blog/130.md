In Korea, drinking is not just a social lubricant; it is a meticulously structured ritual that defines professional and personal relationships. Whether you are a business traveler attending a 'Hoesik' (company dinner) or a tourist exploring the neon-lit streets of Hongdae, understanding the three key elements of Korean drinking culture is essential for survival.

### 1. The 'Cha' System: The Marathon of Rounds
Korean drinking sessions almost never end at one location. They are divided into "Cha" (rounds).
- **1st Round (Il-cha):** Usually focused on food. This is typically at a Korean BBQ (K-BBQ) restaurant where you eat Samgyeopsal and have your first few glasses of Soju.
- **2nd Round (I-cha):** The move to a 'Pocha' (street bar) or a pub for lighter snacks like dried fish (Anju) and beer.
- **3rd Round (Sam-cha):** This is where the night peaks, often at a Noraebang (Karaoke) or a 24-hour soup house (Haejang-guk) to start the 'hangover cure' before the night even ends.

### 2. The Art of Somaek: The Golden Ratio
While Soju and Beer are great on their own, the most popular drink in Korea is **Somaek** (Soju + Maekju/Beer). There is an actual science to the "Golden Ratio"—usually 3 parts Soju to 7 parts Beer. Masters of Somaek use special techniques, like tapping the bottom of the glass with a spoon to create a "tornado" of bubbles that perfectly mixes the two liquids.

### 3. Anju: The Essential Food Pairing
You never drink "empty" in Korea. Every drink must be accompanied by **Anju** (drinking snacks). From spicy Tteokbokki and crispy fried chicken to savoury Pajeon (pancakes), the food is just as important as the alcohol. In many bars, you are actually required to order at least one Anju dish with your drinks.

### FAQ: Social Etiquette
**Q: How do I survive a long Hoesik?**
A: Pace yourself. It is okay to leave a little bit of drink in your glass to slow down the refills. Also, never pour your own drink—it is considered bad luck!
**Q: What is the most common toast?**
A: "Geon-bae!" (Cheers!) is the standard. If you are with colleagues, it's polite to clink your glass slightly lower than your superior's glass as a sign of respect.
