# Live Octopus Moving in Your Mouth

Here is some `food` that is still alive even if you chew it with your teeth two or three times.

### It's live octopus.

`Live octopus`, known as "`산낙지`" in Korea, is a dish that remains lively even after multiple chews. For Koreans, it's just another type of raw seafood, not considered unusual or extraordinary, and is a part of everyday cuisine.

### Foreigners' Fascination

However, many countries around the world are not familiar with eating live octopus. This cultural delicacy has been featured several times on Korean entertainment shows, showcasing foreigners trying it for the first time. Each time, their reactions were a mix of enjoyment and surprise.

### Common Reactions

Foreigners often exhibit astonishment at the sight of the moving tentacles, even when the octopus is cut into pieces. Despite their initial shock, many find the experience enjoyable and amusing. The visual of a moving octopus tends to make foreigners serious and contemplative, leading to comments like "`a live octopus attacked me!`" when they struggle to chew it.

### Cultural Perspective

These reactions can be quite entertaining to Koreans, who are used to this dish. Foreigners often end their experience by acknowledging their desire to try something new and unusual, describing it as both enjoyable and strange.
