# Beyond The Kimchi Journey

How did you learn about the country called Korea? 

BTS? 

PSY’s Gangnam Style? 

Son Heung-min? 

Kimchi? 

Or something else?

### New Perspective

Whatever it is, forget about Korea as you know it so far. 

Korea is more `fun`, `exciting`, and `thrilling` than you thought. 

It’s also `sad`, `depressing`, and `heartbreaking`.

### Rich History

With a history of 5,000 years as one nation, Korea, which was in ruins after the Korean War in the 1950s, developed at a tremendous pace and rose to the ranks of economic powers. Korea's music and film content industry has achieved remarkable success since the 2000s.

### Korean People

At the center of all of this are Koreans. But behind the success of this remarkable country, there are also great sorrows.

### Historical Tragedies

In 1994, the Seongsu Bridge collapsed. 

In 1995, the Sampoong Department Store collapsed. 

In 2003, the Daegu subway fire disaster occurred. 

In 2014, the Sewol Ferry disaster happened. 

And the Itaewon disaster in 2022.
