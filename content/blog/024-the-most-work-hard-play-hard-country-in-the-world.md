# Discover Why Korea is Renowned for Its Unique Balance of Intense Work and Play

No matter how much you think about it, there are no people in the world who work as crazy and play as crazy as Koreans.

### 24/7 Lifestyle

Restaurants, convenience stores, and PC rooms are all open `24 hours a day`. 

Also, in Korea, during that time, some people may be drunk and having fun, while others are working.

### Top Working Hours

Comparing annual working hours by country around the world, Korea is overwhelmingly ranked among the top.

### Economic Ranking

As of 2024, Korea `ranks 13th` in the world economy. Why are they still working like crazy?

### Work-Life Balance

In Korea, there is a term called ‘`work-life balance`.’ It is a new term that originated with the purpose of improving the quality of life by balancing working hours and leisure time.

However, there is a fact that Koreans are overlooking. It's balance. 

In work and life balance, even if work becomes heavy, if life becomes heavy, then balance is eventually achieved.

### Achieving Balance

So isn't that why Koreans work like crazy and play like crazy to achieve this balance?

### Ask a Korean

If you have any Korean friends around you, ask them. 

Is your country number 1 in work hard play hard or not?
