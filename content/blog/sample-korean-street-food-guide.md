## Tteokbokki (떡볶이): The Spicy Rice Cake King

**Tteokbokki** is arguably the most iconic Korean street food. These chewy rice cakes are cooked in a sweet and spicy gochujang (red chili paste) sauce, creating an addictive combination that keeps people coming back for more.

### What Makes It Special

The magic of tteokbokki lies in its texture and sauce. The rice cakes (tteok) are cylindrical and have a uniquely chewy, almost bouncy texture. The sauce is a perfect balance of:

- **Spicy**: From gochujang (Korean red chili paste)
- **Sweet**: From sugar or corn syrup
- **Savory**: From fish cakes and anchovy broth
- **Umami**: From the combination of ingredients

### Where to Find It

Tteokbokki is everywhere in Korea! Look for:

- **Street stalls** near subway stations
- **Traditional markets** like Gwangjang Market in Seoul
- **Pojangmacha** (covered street food tents)
- **Dedicated tteokbokki restaurants** for fancier versions

### Pro Tip

If you can't handle spice, ask for "안 맵게 해주세요" (an maepge haejuseyo), which means "please make it not spicy." Most vendors will happily adjust the spice level for you!

## Hotteok (호떡): Sweet Korean Pancakes

![Korean Hotteok Sweet Pancake](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1626200419199-391ae4be7a41?w=800&q=80)

**Hotteok** is a sweet, doughy pancake filled with a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, and crushed peanuts. It's especially popular during winter, when vendors serve them piping hot from griddles.

### The Experience

Watching hotteok being made is part of the fun:

1. The vendor takes a ball of dough
2. Fills it with the sweet mixture
3. Flattens it on a hot griddle with a special press
4. Cooks until golden and crispy on the outside

When you bite into a freshly made hotteok, the hot, sweet filling oozes out, creating a perfect contrast with the crispy exterior.

### Best Time to Eat

While available year-round, hotteok is best enjoyed:

- **Winter months** (December to February)
- **Evening time** when the air is cool
- **At traditional markets** for the most authentic experience

### Popular Variations

Modern hotteok comes in many flavors:

- **Classic**: Brown sugar, cinnamon, peanuts
- **Ssiat hotteok**: Filled with seeds (sunflower, pumpkin)
- **Cheese hotteok**: Savory version with melted cheese
- **Green tea hotteok**: Infused with matcha powder

## Odeng (오뎅): Fish Cake Skewers

![Korean Odeng Fish Cake](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583394838336-acd977736f90?w=800&q=80)

**Odeng** (also called eomuk) consists of fish cakes on skewers, served in a warm, savory broth. It's the perfect comfort food on a cold day and incredibly affordable.

### How It Works

At an odeng stand, you'll see:

- Large pots of simmering broth
- Dozens of fish cake skewers floating in the broth
- Small paper cups for the broth

The process is simple:

1. Pick as many skewers as you want
2. Get a cup of the warm broth (usually free)
3. Eat the fish cakes
4. Pay based on the number of sticks you took

### The Broth

The broth is the secret star of odeng. Made from:

- **Anchovy stock**: For deep umami flavor
- **Radish**: For sweetness
- **Kelp**: For additional umami
- **Soy sauce**: For saltiness

Many people say the broth is even better than the fish cakes themselves!

### Best Locations

For the best odeng experience, visit:

- **Busan**: Known for having the best odeng in Korea
- **Myeongdong** in Seoul: Tourist-friendly with many stalls
- **Namdaemun Market**: Traditional market atmosphere

![Korean Bungeoppang Fish Pastry](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578985545062-69928b1d9587?w=800&q=80)

**Bungeoppang** is a fish-shaped pastry filled with sweet red bean paste. Despite its name (which means "carp bread"), it contains no fish – the shape is purely decorative!

### Cultural Significance

Bungeoppang is deeply associated with Korean winter and nostalgia. For many Koreans, the sight of bungeoppang vendors signals the arrival of winter, and the taste brings back childhood memories.

### The Making Process

Bungeoppang is made in special fish-shaped molds:

1. Batter is poured into the mold
2. Red bean paste is added
3. More batter covers the filling
4. The mold is closed and cooked

The result is a crispy exterior with a warm, sweet filling.

### Modern Variations

While red bean is traditional, modern versions include:

- **Custard cream**: Sweet and creamy
- **Pizza**: Cheese and tomato sauce
- **Nutella**: Chocolate hazelnut
- **Sweet potato**: Mashed sweet potato filling
