# Discover the Best Korean Dramas on Netflix: From Fantasy to Romance

### Goblin

**Translated Content**:

"**Goblin**" is a hugely popular fantasy drama about an immortal goblin and his bride. 

The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is perfect. 

The acting by the leads, `Kim Go-eun` and `Gong Yoo`, is fantastic, and the supporting roles played by `Yoo In-na` and `Lee Dong-wook` are just as great.
