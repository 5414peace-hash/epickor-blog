In the Western world, drinking is often a relaxed, individualistic activity. In Korea, drinking is a competitive, high-energy team sport. If you find yourself at a "Hoesik" (company dinner) or a gathering of university students, you will inevitably be pulled into the world of **K-Drinking Games**. These games are the social glue of Korea, designed to melt away the strict social hierarchies and turn strangers into best friends in a matter of shots.

### 1. The Culture of 'Hoesik' and Breaking the Ice
Korea’s social structure is deeply influenced by Confucianism, where age and rank matter. However, the drinking table is the one place where these walls come down. Drinking games serve as the catalyst for this transformation. They are loud, rhythmic, and demand constant attention. The motto is simple: *"If you lose, you drink. If you win, you survive."*

### 2. Beginner-Friendly Games You Must Know
If you're new to the scene, these three games are the absolute staples:
- **The Bottle Cap Game:** This is the most common game played with Soju. You twist the wire from the cap until it's barely attached, then take turns flicking it. The person who flicks it off wins, and the people to their left and right have to drink.
- **Baskin Robbins 31:** Players count from 1 to 31 in sequence. You can say up to three numbers. The person forced to say "31" takes the shot. It's a game of strategy disguised as counting!
- **Titanic (Submarine):** You float a small shot glass in a large beer glass filled with Somaek (Soju + Beer). Everyone takes turns pouring a tiny bit of Soju into the shot glass. The person who makes the "Submarine" sink has to drink the entire glass.

### 3. The Ritualistic Chants
Every game has a "theme song." Before a game starts, the group will chant in unison to set the beat. For example, during the *Strawberry (Ddal-gi) Game*, the group claps and pats their knees in a 4-beat rhythm while chanting "Ddal-gi! Ddal-gi! Ddal-gi! Ddal-gi!" Missing a single beat is a guaranteed ticket to a shot of Soju.

### 4. Important Drinking Etiquette (Manners)
While games are wild, the rules of respect still apply:
1. **The Two-Hand Rule:** Always pour and receive drinks with two hands when with elders or superiors.
2. **The Turn-Away:** When drinking in front of someone older, turn your head to the side as a sign of respect.
3. **Never an Empty Glass:** In Korea, you never let your friend's glass stay empty. Refill it as soon as it's drained (but never refill a half-full glass!).

### FAQ: Survival Tips
**Q: What if I can't drink much?**
A: It is perfectly acceptable to ask for water or soda, but you should still participate in the games! The fun is in the rhythm and the social interaction, not just the alcohol.
**Q: Are these games only for young people?**
A: While more common among students and young professionals, you'll be surprised how many "Ajusshis" (middle-aged men) are masters of these games from their own college days.
