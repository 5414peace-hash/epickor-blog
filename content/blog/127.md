Many travelers are surprised to learn that South Korea is one of the few places on Earth where you can experience a 60-degree Celsius temperature swing within a single year. It is a land of **Extreme Seasons**. From the humid, monsoon-heavy summers that feel like a sauna to the bone-chilling Siberian winds of winter, Koreans have spent centuries perfecting the art of seasonal survival.

### 1. The Korean Summer: More Than Just Heat
July and August in Korea are not just "hot"—they are **Tropical**. 
- **The Humidity:** The humidity often stays above 80%, making the air feel thick. 
- **The Monsoon (Jangma):** Massive rainstorms can last for weeks, turning the city into a grey, misty landscape. 
- **Survival Strategy:** Koreans battle this with *"I-yeol-chi-yeol"* (Fighting Heat with Heat). You will see crowds lining up in the swelering heat to eat **Samgyetang** (Boiling Ginseng Chicken Soup) to replenish their energy. Alternatively, **Naengmyeon** (Buckwheat Noodles in Icy Broth) is the go-to for instant cooling.

### 2. The Korean Winter: The Siberian Express
In December, the wind shifts. Cold air from Siberia rushes down the peninsula, dropping temperatures in Seoul to as low as -15°C (5°F). 
- **The Long Padding:** You will notice a sea of black, ankle-length puffer coats. Known as "Long Paddings," these have become the national survival uniform of Korea. 
- **Ondol (Floor Heating):** The secret weapon against winter is inside the home. Korea's traditional *Ondol* system heats the floors directly, keeping your feet warm even if the air is chilly. It’s why Koreans traditionally spend so much time sitting and sleeping on the floor.

### 3. The Golden Windows: Spring and Autumn
Because the extremes are so harsh, Koreans cherish Spring (April-May) and Autumn (October-November) with a passion. 
- **Spring:** A brief, magical two weeks of Cherry Blossoms. 
- **Autumn:** The most beautiful time to visit, as the mountains turn vibrant shades of red and gold, and the air is crisp and dry.

### FAQ: Travel Planning
**Q: When is the absolute worst time to visit?**
A: If you hate being uncomfortable, avoid late July (too humid) and late January (too cold). However, these times offer the lowest prices for flights and hotels.
**Q: Do I need special gear for a Korean winter?**
A: Layers are key. Thermal inner-wear (like Uniqlo's Heattech) is a must. Don't worry if you forget; Korean convenience stores sell hand-warmers (Hot-packs) that last for 12 hours.
**Q: Does it snow a lot in Seoul?**
A: It snows occasionally, but the air is often too dry for heavy blizzards. For real snow, you should head to the Gangwon-do province (home of the 2018 Winter Olympics).
