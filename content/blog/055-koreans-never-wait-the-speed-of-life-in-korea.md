# Discover How Korea's Fast-Paced Culture Eliminates Waiting

`Koreans never wait.` 

Korea, a country faster than you can imagine, embodies a culture where 'waiting' is almost non-existent.

### Dining Efficiency

When calling a waiter at a restaurant, don’t wait for them to notice you. There’s a `wireless bell` next to the table. Press it, and it rings at the waiter’s station, just like calling a flight attendant on a plane.

Koreans don’t wait to order. When you sit down at a restaurant, there’s an `electronic menu` at each seat. As soon as you sit, you order through this menu, completing your order without needing to call a waiter. Sometimes, `payment` is even made all at once.

### Self-service Convenience

So what do you do when you need things like spoons, chopsticks, or napkins? Koreans never wait. Look next to the dining table, and you’ll see a `drawer`. Just take what you need from there.

### Fast Delivery

What’s even more surprising is if you purchase something from `Coupang`, a company like `Amazon` in Korea, as long as you order before 11 PM, it will arrive at your doorstep the next morning before work. Isn’t that unbelievable? But it’s true.
