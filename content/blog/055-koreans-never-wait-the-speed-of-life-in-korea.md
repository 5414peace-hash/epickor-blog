# Discover How Korea's Fast-Paced Culture Eliminates Waiting

`Koreans never wait.` 

Korea, a country faster than you can imagine, embodies a culture where 'waiting' is almost non-existent.

### Dining Efficiency

When calling a waiter at a restaurant, don’t wait for them to notice you. There’s a `wireless bell` next to the table. Press it, and it rings at the waiter’s station, just like calling a flight attendant on a plane.

Koreans don’t wait to order. When you sit down at a restaurant, there’s an `electronic menu` at each seat. As soon as you sit, you order through this menu, completing your order without needing to call a waiter. Sometimes, `payment` is even made all at once.

So what do you do when you need things like spoons, chopsticks, or napkins? Koreans never wait. Look next to the dining table, and you’ll see a `drawer`. Just take what you need from there.

### Fast Delivery

What’s even more surprising is if you purchase something from `Coupang`, a company like `Amazon` in Korea, as long as you order before 11 PM, it will arrive at your doorstep the next morning before work. Isn’t that unbelievable? But it’s true.
