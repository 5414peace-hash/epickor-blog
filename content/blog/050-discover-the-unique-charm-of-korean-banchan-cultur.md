# Korea "Banchan" Food Culture 🇰🇷

### Korea Gives Food Even If You Don't Order It

😮 People who eat at a Korean restaurant for the first time are often surprised to see food that they didn't order keep coming out.

### Banchan Culture

⭐️ Korea has a “`banchan`” culture in its food culture. ⭐️

The basic foods eaten with the main menu and rice are called "banchan" or side dishes. Usually, Korean food is eaten with several side dishes centered around one main menu, or the side dishes often become the main menu themselves.

### Kimchi as Banchan

✔️ Kimchi, the representative Korean food, is also considered a side dish "banchan" to Koreans, not a food or menu item.
