For a 100% flirting failure, we especially recommend dramas like "The Heirs" and "Boys Over Flowers." These are the lines for you to mimic:

**Boys Over Flowers:**

1. "Do you see it? My heart?"
2. "From today, I officially announce that she is my girlfriend."

**The Heirs:**

1. "Do I like you?"
2. "Nevertheless, go straight."
