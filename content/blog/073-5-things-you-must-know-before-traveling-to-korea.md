# Essential Tips for a Safe and Comfortable Trip to South Korea

### 1. Expect to Be Stared At

First, you will be stared at wherever you go. Korea is a country comprised of a single ethnic group, so regardless of whether you're white, black, or Asian, it's common for people to look at you, especially in public places like the subway, buses, or taxis. Don’t take it personally—`no offense` is intended by Koreans.

### 2. Korea Is Extremely Safe

Second, Korea is incredibly safe, even 24/7. There are almost no thieves because they are sure to get caught. `CCTV cameras` are everywhere, covering all areas, so there are no blind spots. Feel secure no matter where you go.

### 3. Be Polite

Third, politeness is crucial. Koreans highly value manners and etiquette. Most Korean men are required to serve in the military, and in school, regardless of gender, students used to be punished for mistakes (though this no longer happens). Always remember: "`Manners make the human.`"

### 4. Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help

Fourth, don't assume Koreans are cold. They may appear blunt at first, but it’s likely because you haven’t asked. Once you ask, they’ll gladly help and answer your questions sincerely. This is especially true for information desks and police stations, where people are `exceptionally friendly`.
