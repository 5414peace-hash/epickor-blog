## Beyond the Stadium Lights
Everyone knows **BTS**. They have topped the Billboard charts, spoken at the United Nations, and sold out stadiums from London to LA. But behind the perfectly choreographed performances and the global "ARMY" phenomenon lies a story of incredible hardship, controversial encounters, and quirky group dynamics that many new fans might not know.

Here are 9 hidden facts about the journey of the seven members who changed the world.

### 1. The 'Blood Type' Anomaly
In Korea, blood types are often associated with personality traits (similar to zodiac signs). A curious fact about BTS is that **none of the seven members have blood type B.** * **The Breakdown:** Jin and Sug are Type O. RM and V are Type AB. J-Hope, Jimin, and Jungkook are Type A. In a group of seven, the statistical absence of Type B is quite rare in Korea!

### 2. The B-FREE Controversy
Before they were global icons, BTS faced open disrespect from the Korean underground rap scene. In 2013, rapper **B-FREE** famously insulted RM and Suga during a broadcast, mocking them for wearing makeup and "selling out" as idols. 
* **The Irony:** While BTS went on to achieve unprecedented global fame, B-FREE has recently made headlines in Korea for legal troubles related to interfering with political campaigns. It is a story of "living well is the best revenge."

### 3. RM’s Secret 'Debut' in 2010
While BTS officially debuted on June 13, 2013, **RM** was actually heard on a professional track much earlier. On September 30, 2010, he featured in singer Lim Jeong-hee’s song *"JAE"*. Even then, his lyrical talent was undeniable.

### 4. High School Rap Battles: RM vs. Changmo
Before they were superstars, RM and the legendary Korean rapper **Changmo** shared a stage together during their high school days. There is a grainy video of the two of them rapping on the same stage—two future kings of the Korean music scene starting from zero.

### 5. Bang Si-hyuk’s Multi-Billion Won Gamble
When BTS was preparing to debut, **Bang Si-hyuk** (the founder of Big Hit) was billions of won in debt. The company was on the verge of bankruptcy. Despite the immense pressure, he believed in the seven members and bet everything on their debut. It was a "do or die" moment for everyone involved.

### 6. The 11-Person Dormitory
Before they lived in luxury apartments at Nine One Hannam, BTS lived in a tiny, cramped dormitory. Suga once revealed that at one point, **up to 11 trainees were sleeping in a single room.** They shared one bathroom and ate meals on the floor. These humble beginnings are what forged their legendary teamwork.

### 7. Suga’s Secret Job
During his trainee days, Suga worked a part-time job as a delivery driver to make ends meet. He was actually involved in a car accident while making a delivery, which resulted in a shoulder injury that he hid from the company for years, fearing he would be cut from the group. He eventually had surgery for this injury in 2020.

### 8. Jin’s Military Milestone
Jin, the oldest member, was the first to enlist. His discharge date is **June 12, 2024**—just one day before the group's 11th anniversary. It will be a massive moment for fans worldwide.

### 9. The 2025 Reunion
With Suga scheduled to be discharged on **June 21, 2025**, all seven members will have completed their mandatory military service. The year 2025 is already being hailed as the "Year of the BTS Return," with the world eagerly awaiting their first full-group comeback in years.

### Conclusion: The Power of Perseverance
The story of BTS is not just about catchy songs; it is a testament to the power of hard work, loyalty, and staying true to oneself despite the odds. From 11 people in one room to the top of the world, they are a true icon of our time.
