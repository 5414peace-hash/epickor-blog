# A Korean Snack Loved by Japanese

When Japanese people travel to Korea, one of the must-try items they always buy at convenience stores is `Viyott yogurt`.

### Convenient and Tasty

Yogurt and toppings are provided together, so you can mix them and enjoy. 

Many Japanese tourists feature Viyott in their vlogs, showing its widespread popularity.

### Unique to Korea

Viyott cannot be exported due to its expiration date, making it exclusive to Korea. 

This exclusivity adds to its appeal among Japanese visitors.

### Quality Ingredients

Despite many similar products, Viyott's yogurt stands out because it is made solely from milk, giving it a superior taste. Additionally, a special processing method ensures a clean lid with almost no yogurt residue.

### Delicious Combination

The combination of yogurt and `chocolate rings` is exceptionally delicious.
