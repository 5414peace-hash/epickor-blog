⭐️ Korea has a “`banchan`” culture in its food culture. ⭐️

The basic foods eaten with the main menu and rice are called "banchan" or side dishes. Usually, Korean food is eaten with several side dishes centered around one main menu, or the side dishes often become the main menu themselves.

### Kimchi as Banchan

✔️ Kimchi, the representative Korean food, is also considered a side dish "banchan" to Koreans, not a food or menu item.

### Example of Banchan

For example, when you go to eat tteokbokki, you get tteokbokki and pickled radish. Here, tteokbokki is the main dish, and pickled radish is the banchan.

### Variety of Side Dishes

👉 Have you ever been surprised by the variety of side dishes served at a Korean restaurant?
