### Key Events: What Happened?

**Martial Law Declared**:

On `December 3, 2024`, at precisely 10:28 PM, President Yoon shocked the nation by declaring martial law. The announcement came amidst heightened political tensions, with the government citing severe disruptions caused by the opposition's budget cuts and allegations of electoral fraud.

**Martial Law Lifted**:

In an unprecedented turn of events, the National Assembly acted swiftly, voting at 1:01 AM on `December 4` to demand the lifting of martial law. By 4:28 AM, just hours after it began, President Yoon officially revoked the order.

President Yoon justified his controversial decision by pointing to a government deadlock allegedly orchestrated by the opposition party. He accused them of slashing critical budgets and propagating baseless claims of election fraud. The declaration of martial law, according to Yoon, was a last-resort measure to stabilize the nation.

However, critics argue that these actions only deepened the crisis, undermining public trust in his leadership and the broader political system.

### The Impeachment Process

**Impeachment Motion Passed**:

On December 7, 2024, the National Assembly passed a motion to impeach President Yoon. Following intense deliberations and public pressure, the motion was confirmed in a second vote on December 14, 2024.

**What’s Next?**:

`The Supreme Court` now holds the key to South Korea's political future. They have a timeline of 3-6 months to decide whether the impeachment will be upheld or dismissed. Until then, the presidency remains in limbo, and the country awaits a decisive verdict.

### The People’s Voice

South Korea’s streets became the stage for a powerful display of democratic activism. Nearly one million citizens braved freezing temperatures to participate in peaceful protests. Their message was clear: they demanded accountability and swift action from lawmakers to preserve the integrity of democracy.

### A History of Presidential Impeachments

This marks the `third time` in South Korea’s history that a sitting president has faced impeachment. Out of the previous two cases, one was upheld, leading to the removal of the president, while the other was dismissed.
