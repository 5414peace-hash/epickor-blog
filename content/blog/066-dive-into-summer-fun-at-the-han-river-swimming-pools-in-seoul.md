# Special Swimming Pool in Korea

The `Han River`, a huge river that runs through Seoul, the capital of South Korea. 

People in Korea spend a lot of time relaxing and exercising at the `Han River parks`.

### Summer Fun

In the summer, the `outdoor swimming pools` at the Han River in Seoul open up for some fun right in the city. They usually operate from June to August each year, and in 2024, they'll be open every day until August 18th, unless there's bad weather like a typhoon.
