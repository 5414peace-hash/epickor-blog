# Seaweed Soup on Birthdays in Korea

Usually, people of all ages and genders eat cake on their birthdays, regardless of nationality. However, there are many countries where people eat certain foods on their birthdays. 

In Korea, we always eat `seaweed soup`.

### Seaweed Soup

It's literally a soup made with seaweed. It would be difficult to find a person in Korea who hasn't had seaweed soup on their `birthday`.

### Iron and Recovery

Because seaweed is good for replenishing iron, mothers in Korea usually ate seaweed soup as a recovery meal after giving birth to a baby.

In fact, seaweed is so good for human health that it has been called the king of seaweeds and prized since ancient times. At the same time, in Korea, which has a peninsular terrain, seaweed was easily available in coastal areas, so it was able to become a special food to celebrate birthdays.
