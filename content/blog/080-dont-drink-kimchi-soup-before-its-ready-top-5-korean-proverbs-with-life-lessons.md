### 1. **Don’t Drink Kimchi Soup Before It’s Ready**

**Translated Content**:

This Korean saying, `"김치국부터 마시지 마라,"` is a reminder not to get ahead of yourself. It parallels the English proverb, "Don’t count your chickens before they hatch." Just as you wouldn’t drink unready kimchi soup, this wisdom tells us to wait for the right time and not assume outcomes prematurely. Patience is key in life, especially when it comes to success and planning.
