# **How to Fail 100% at Flirting in Korea**

If you've found a Korean you like, `don't do this.`

### STEP 1: Watch Korean Dramas Starring “Lee Min-ho”

Some of you might learn about romance through Korean dramas. Remember the romantic sensibility of the dramas featuring Korean actor "Lee Min-ho."

### STEP 2: Mimic Lines from Korean Dramas Starring “Lee Min-ho”

For a 100% flirting failure, we especially recommend dramas like "The Heirs" and "Boys Over Flowers." These are the lines for you to mimic:

**Boys Over Flowers:**

1. "Do you see it? My heart?"
2. "From today, I officially announce that she is my girlfriend."

**The Heirs:**

1. "Do I like you?"
2. "Nevertheless, go straight."
