Next, the woman’s name is Hyeja Kim. 

She's a famous Korean actress, loved for her memorable performances in dramas and movies. Interestingly, her name is also used in the phrase 'Hyeja-like,' which means something is generous and plentiful. This came about because of her association with a food brand known for its large portions and high quality.
