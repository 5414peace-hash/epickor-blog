## The Paradox of Korean Safety
If you've ever spent a night in a Seoul cafe, you've seen the miracle of Korean public safety: a person leaves their $2,000 MacBook Pro on a table, walks away to the restroom for 10 minutes, and returns to find it untouched. You can drop your wallet in the middle of Myeongdong and, more often than not, find it at the local police station with every single won intact. 

But there is a dark, baffling exception to this rule of honesty. There is one item that no Korean—regardless of how honest they are—seems to be able to resist. **The Bicycle.**

In a country where pickpocketing is virtually non-existent, bicycle theft is a national sport. Why? Let's dive into the puzzling phenomenon of the 'Eom Bok-dong' nation.

### 1. The Statistical Anomaly
Statistically, bicycle theft in Korea is roughly **43 times higher** than pickpocketing and **3 times higher** than store theft. It is the only crime that a "normal, law-abiding citizen" might consider committing. 

* **The 'Abandoned' Logic:** Many Koreans don't view taking a bike as "stealing" in the traditional sense. If a bike is unlocked or looks like it hasn't moved in a few days, the psychological barrier drops. It's viewed as "borrowing" or "recycling" an abandoned item.
* **The Low Stakes:** Historically, police have treated bicycle theft as a minor civil matter rather than a serious crime. This lack of severe consequences has created a culture where the risk-to-reward ratio for taking a bike is perceived as very low.

### 2. The Legacy of Eom Bok-dong: "The Nation of Bicycle Thieves"
Koreans often jokingly refer to themselves as the "Nation of Eom Bok-dong." 

* **Who was he?** Eom Bok-dong was a legendary Korean cyclist during the Japanese colonial era. He was a national hero who defeated Japanese riders in major races, providing a rare sense of pride to a colonized people.
* **The Twist:** Despite his hero status, he was also a habitual bicycle thief who served prison time. This duality—a national hero who stole bikes—has become a long-running meme in Korea, used to explain why otherwise good people can't stop stealing bicycles.

### 3. The 'Public Goods' Mentality
There is a unique social psychology at play here. In the Korean mindset, certain things are viewed almost as "public goods" if they are left in public spaces for too long. 
* **The Umbrella Rule:** Umbrellas and bicycles fall into the same category. If it's raining and there's an umbrella in a stand, some feel it's okay to "borrow" it for a one-way trip. The same applies to a bike left at a subway station. 
* **The Contrast:** This logic *never* applies to laptops or smartphones. Those are personal, private items containing data. A bike is just a piece of metal used for transportation.

### 4. Survival Tips for Cyclists in Korea
If you plan on owning a bike in Seoul, follow these rules or prepare to walk:
* **The "Two-Lock" Minimum:** Use a heavy U-lock and a cable lock. If it takes more than 60 seconds to steal, they’ll move to the next bike.
* **Indoor Storage:** If your bike is worth more than $500, never leave it outside overnight. 
* **The 'Ugly' Strategy:** Many seasoned Seoulites purposely use beat-up, old-looking bikes for their daily commute to make them less tempting.

### Conclusion: The Flaw in the Matrix
Bicycle theft remains the "glitch" in the otherwise perfect matrix of South Korean public safety. It is a cultural quirk that even Koreans find hard to explain. So, keep your laptop on the table, but for heaven's sake, lock your bike to a permanent structure with the strongest chain you can find.
