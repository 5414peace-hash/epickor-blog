If you drop your wallet while walking and come back to retrieve it later, it’s still there.

### The Exception

But strangely enough, Koreans have never been able to keep this one thing from a young age. Something that someone unknown keeps stealing. Something that every Korean has lost at least once. Yes, it’s “a `bicycle`”.

### Bicycle Theft

Is it because bicycles sell well as second-hand vehicles and have the advantage of being easy to cash out?

According to actual statistics, bicycle theft in Korea is 43 times higher than pickpocketing and 3 times higher than store theft.

### Cultural Reference

That’s why Koreans call their country `“Eom Bok-dong’s country”`. Eom Bok-dong was a former Korean cyclist. He was famous for his outstanding cycling skills, winning several competitions, and even served time in prison for habitual bicycle theft.

### Puzzling Phenomenon

Anyway, even Koreans don’t understand the rate of bicycle theft in Korea.

### Final Advice

If you want to live in Korea, just keep one thing in mind. Yes. `The bicycle`.
