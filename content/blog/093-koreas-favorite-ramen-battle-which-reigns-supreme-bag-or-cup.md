### 🏠 Bag Ramen: The Home-Cooked Hero

**Bag ramen** is perfect when you want a fully customizable meal. Want to crack an egg in? Go for it. Add scallions, mushrooms, kimchi, cheese, or even dumplings — the pot is your playground.

The flavor is richer and deeper because you boil the noodles and soup base yourself, which gives better texture and aroma. Many Korean families even have their own "secret recipe" for making their favorite bag ramen taste extra special.

Whether you like it spicy, creamy, or extra garlicky, **bag ramen lets you make it your way**.

### 🥡 Cup Ramen: Fast, Easy, Anywhere

On the flip side, **cup ramen** is the king of convenience. Just peel back the lid, pour in hot water, and wait three minutes. Boom — you’re eating.

**Cup ramen is the go-to choice for students during exam season, hikers at mountain peaks, office workers during breaks, and night owls craving a midnight bite.**

Modern cup ramen comes in so many variations too — from seafood to cheese buldak, and even udon-style noodles. It’s light, portable, and perfect for spontaneous cravings.

If instant satisfaction is what you’re after, **cup ramen never disappoints**.
