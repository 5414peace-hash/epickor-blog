# Explore why pajeon and makgeolli are the ultimate comfort foods for Koreans on rainy days.

`When it rains`, Koreans all seem to think of the same food, like they have some kind of telepathy. 

That food is `pajeon`, a Korean-style pancake made by mixing green onions, seafood, and flour, and frying it in oil.

### Ultimate Pairing

It's often paired with `makgeolli`, a traditional Korean rice wine that's milky white. Together, pajeon and makgeolli make up the ultimate rainy-day comfort food for Koreans.
