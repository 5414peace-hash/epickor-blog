**Seollal**, the Lunar New Year, is the most significant traditional holiday in South Korea. It is a time for family reunions, honoring ancestors, and—of course—eating specific foods that symbolize a fresh start. While the cities of Seoul and Busan often become quiet as people return to their hometowns, the traditional rituals within Korean homes are vibrant and full of meaning.

### 1. The Ritual of Sebae: Bowing for Blessings
The morning of Seollal begins with **Sebae**, a formal bow to the elders. Family members dress in their finest **Hanbok** (traditional clothing) and perform a deep bow to their parents and grandparents, wishing them a happy and healthy new year. In return, the elders give "Sebae-don" (New Year’s money) and words of wisdom (Deokdam).

### 2. Tteokguk: Eating Your Way to a New Year
In Korea, you don't actually turn a year older on your birthday—you turn a year older by eating a bowl of **Tteokguk** (sliced rice cake soup) on Seollal morning. The white, coin-shaped rice cakes symbolize purity and wealth.
- **The Meaning:** The long, cylinder rice cake (Garae-tteok) used to make the soup symbolizes longevity.
- **The Taste:** A rich, savoury beef or anchovy broth topped with thin strips of egg, seaweed, and sometimes Mandu (dumplings).

### 3. Folk Games and Ancestral Rites (Charye)
Families also perform **Charye**, a memorial service for their ancestors, offering food and wine on a meticulously arranged table. After the formal parts are over, it's time for **Yutnori**, a traditional board game involving four wooden sticks. It’s a loud, competitive, and fun way to bond with relatives of all ages.

### FAQ: Visiting during Seollal
**Q: Is it a good time for tourists to visit?**
A: It depends. Most major tourist attractions like palaces stay open and even host special events. However, many local shops and restaurants may close for 3 days.
**Q: How do I wish someone a Happy New Year in Korean?**
A: "Sae-hae bok mani badeuseyo!" (새해 복 많이 받으세요!), which literally means "May you receive a lot of blessings in the New Year."
