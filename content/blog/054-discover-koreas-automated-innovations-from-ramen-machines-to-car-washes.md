# How advanced is automation in Korea?

### Ramen Machines

You probably already know that Korea is famous for ramen like Shin Ramyun and Buldak. 

But have you ever seen a `machine that makes ramen`? They say the ramen made by this machine tastes even better than the one made by people.

If you're traveling to Korea, head over to a convenience store in Hangang Park right away. 

Any park along the Han River, whether in Gangnam or Gangbuk, will do because there's always a convenience store nearby. 

This ramen-making machine simply opens a regular bag of ramen, adds the soup, and `automatically` does everything from adjusting the amount of water to boiling and stopping. All you have to do is stir it gently with chopsticks in between.

And that's not all. 

If you ever go to a gas station in Korea, be sure to check out the automatic `car wash machine`. 

Just put your car in neutral, sit back, and watch as it moves on its own along the rails, automatically doing everything from a soap bubble massage to high-pressure water `washing and final drying`.
