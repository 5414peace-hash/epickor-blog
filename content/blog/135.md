If you walk down a busy street in Seoul and shout "Mr. Kim!", at least one in five people will turn around. With nearly 10 million people sharing the same last name, the sheer number of Kims in Korea is a constant source of fascination for foreigners. But why did this single surname become so dominant? It’s not just a coincidence; it’s a story of royal power, social ambition, and deep-rooted history.

### 1. The Royal Roots: The Silla Kingdom
The story begins over a thousand years ago. **Kim (김, 金)** was the royal surname of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC – 935 AD), which eventually unified the Korean Peninsula. Because the Kims were the ruling family, the name became associated with high social status and divine authority.

### 2. Social Climbing and the 'Kim' Explosion
During the Joseon Dynasty, surnames were a luxury reserved for the aristocracy (Yangban). However, toward the end of the dynasty, as the class system began to crumble, many commoners and even enslaved people sought to acquire surnames to hide their low-born status. 
- **The Strategy:** They adopted the names of powerful clans—primarily Kim, Lee, and Park—to gain protection and prestige. 
- **The Result:** This led to a massive population of Kims, as having the name of a former king was the ultimate way to reinvent one’s identity.

### 3. Not All Kims Are the Same: The 'Bon-gwan' System
Here is where it gets interesting: Not all Kims share the same ancestors. There are over **300 different Kim clans**, and they are distinguished by their **Bon-gwan** (ancestral seat or place of origin).
- **Gimhae Kim:** The largest clan, claiming ancestry from King Suro.
- **Gyeongju Kim:** The second largest, tracing back to the Silla royal family.
Traditionally, Koreans were not allowed to marry someone from the same Bon-gwan, even if they hadn't shared a relative for 500 years!

### 4. FAQ: Meeting a Kim in Korea
**Q: How do I tell Kims apart?**
A: You can’t tell just by looking. If you want to be extra polite, you can ask, "Which Kim are you?" (어느 김씨세요?). It’s a great conversation starter about family history.
**Q: What are the next most common names?**
A: After Kim, it's **Lee (이)** and **Park (박)**. The fourth is **Choi (최)**, though it is significantly less common than the big three.
