# The Ultimate Guide to Korean Wedding Culture: K-Drama Romance vs. Reality

In Korea, a wedding is more than just a union between two people; it's a grand merging of two family empires. While K-Dramas like *Queen of Tears* or *Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha* make it look purely romantic, the reality is a fascinating blend of deep-rooted tradition, high-stakes family negotiations, and ultra-modern commercial efficiency. 

If you are a foreigner invited to a Korean wedding or simply curious about the culture, this deep dive will reveal everything from the "Su-De-Me" holy trinity to the strict rules of congratulatory cash.

### 1. The Official Starting Gun: Sang-gyeon-rye (상견례)

Before any rings are exchanged or invitations are printed, the families must meet for the **Sang-gyeon-rye**. This is the formal dinner where the couple’s parents meet each other for the first time, exchange greetings, and make everything feel official. It is typically held at a high-end traditional Korean restaurant (Hanjeongsik) in a private room.

This is a moment of intense etiquette and subtle negotiation. Parents discuss the couple's family backgrounds and officially "approve" the union. It is widely known that if the Sang-gyeon-rye goes poorly, the marriage can be cancelled then and there.

### 2. Invitations: Why a Text Message Isn't Enough

Next are the invitations. While "Mobile Invitations" via KakaoTalk are common for general acquaintances, the physical invitation remains a pillar of Korean social respect. 

Korean wedding invitations aren’t just casual "save the date" cards. Traditionally, the couple meets their friends and colleagues in person to hand over the invitation over a meal. In Korea, "I'm getting married" usually translates to "I'm buying you dinner." Failing to provide a meal while giving an invitation can be seen as a breach of social contract.

### 3. The "Su-De-Me" Holy Trinity (Studio, Dress, Makeup)

For many Korean couples, **"Su-De-Me"** is the most expensive and time-consuming part of the prep. It stands for:
- **Studio:** Pre-wedding photoshoots that last 8-10 hours in professional studios with elaborate sets.
- **Dress:** Unlike in the West, most Korean brides *rent* several high-end designer dresses (often 3-4 different ones) for the shoot and the ceremony. 
- **Makeup:** Professional makeup artists transform the couple into royalty for the day.

### 4. The 60-Minute Marathon: Wedding Halls & Buffets

The big day in Korea is incredibly efficient. Most ceremonies take place in dedicated **"Wedding Halls"**—buildings designed solely to host weddings, often hosting multiple ceremonies per hour.

- **The Speed:** The main ceremony often lasts only 30 to 60 minutes. There is no time for long speeches; the couple walks down the aisle, bows to their parents, and immediately heads to the photo zone.
- **The Buffet:** The real highlight for guests is the buffet. In Korea, the reputation of a couple's wedding is often judged by the quality of the hall's food. Guests often skip the ceremony and head straight to the dining hall!

### 5. The Golden Rule of Cash: Chuk-ui-geum (축의금)

If you're attending a Korean wedding, leave the gift registry at home. Everyone brings a clean white envelope containing **Chuk-ui-geum** (congratulatory money). 

- **50,000 KRW (~$40):** Casual colleagues or distant acquaintances.
- **100,000 KRW (~$80):** For close friends or if you're bringing a plus-one.
- **200,000+ KRW:** For very close friends or relatives.

You hand over the envelope at the entrance and receive a meal ticket in return. It’s a very transparent social contract! Realistically, this cash helps the couple cover the massive wedding expenses.

### 6. FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What should I wear?**
A: Business formal or smart casual. Avoid wearing white (reserved for the bride) or overly casual clothes like jeans.

**Q: Can I bring a plus-one?**
A: Only if the couple has explicitly invited them. Since wedding buffets are priced per head, unexpected guests can be a financial burden.

**Q: How long should I stay?**
A: Most guests stay for the ceremony and the meal, totaling about 1.5 to 2 hours.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** If you want a photo with the bride, arrive at least 30 minutes early. Once the ceremony starts, she will be whisked away, and you might miss your chance!
