In Korea, the word **"Goods"** (pronounced 'Goot-jeu') refers to a massive economy of official merchandise. From K-Pop idol lightsticks to limited-edition character collaborations, the "Goods Culture" is a testament to the passionate and meticulous nature of Korean fans. It is no longer just about owning a product; it’s about participating in a brand's story.

### 1. K-Pop Goods: The 'Lightstick' and 'Photo Cards'
The most iconic piece of merch is the **Lightstick** (Eung-won-bong). Each group has a unique design that connects to a mobile app to change colors in sync during a concert. 
- **Photo Cards:** Fans buy multiple copies of the same album just to collect the rare "photo cards" hidden inside. These cards have their own secondary market, with some rare cards selling for hundreds of dollars.

### 2. Character Collaborations and 'Open Runs'
Korea's "Goods Culture" extends to characters like **Kakao Friends**, **Line Friends**, and **Zanmang Loopy**. When a major brand (like Starbucks or Nike) does a collaboration in Korea, it often leads to an **"Open Run"**—where people line up at 5 AM just to buy limited-edition goods before they sell out.

### 3. Pop-Up Store Mania
Seongsu-dong and Hannam-dong are the capitals of "Goods Pop-Ups." These stores are temporary experiences where fans can engage with a brand's aesthetic and buy exclusive merchandise that will never be sold again. This "Fear Of Missing Out" (FOMO) is what drives the incredible energy of the market.
