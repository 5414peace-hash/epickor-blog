# Discover the Vibrant Market Culture in Seoul

### Majang Market

**Livestock Products**:

Majang Market is a large market specializing in livestock products and is responsible for more than 60% of all `meat` distribution in Seoul.

**Hanwoo**:

You can buy ‘Hanwoo’, a Korean cattle breed with strict quality control, wholesale at a low price, and there are also meat restaurants where you can taste fresh meat right away.

**Rare Parts**:

You can buy all kinds of meat, including rare parts that only cost a small amount per animal.

Dongmyo Market is a place where all kinds of rare items gather. Here, items are sold very cheaply and there is a wide range of items from new to used things.

**Clothing and Stationery**:

The most famous item here is clothing, and I also recommend checking out Stationery Street, which sells a variety of cute character items.
