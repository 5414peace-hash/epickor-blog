Viyott cannot be exported due to its expiration date, making it exclusive to Korea. 

This exclusivity adds to its appeal among Japanese visitors.

### Quality Ingredients

Despite many similar products, Viyott's yogurt stands out because it is made solely from milk, giving it a superior taste. Additionally, a special processing method ensures a clean lid with almost no yogurt residue.

### Delicious Combination

The combination of yogurt and `chocolate rings` is exceptionally delicious. 

The chocolate rings are imported from a German company, contracted by the 'Seoul Milk' brand, ensuring high quality.

### Lesser-Known Popularity

Interestingly, many Koreans are unaware of Viyott's immense popularity among Japanese tourists.
