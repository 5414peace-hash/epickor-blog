## 🥐 Koreans' Flair for Branding, Even in Food!

Koreans have a remarkable talent for creating captivating brands, not just in cosmetics and tech gadgets, but also in the culinary world. They possess a knack for transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary and infusing familiar concepts with fresh narratives. Today, we'll explore two prominent examples: Paris Baguette and London Bagel Museum, delving into Korea's distinctive bakery culture.

## 🥖 Paris Baguette: A Staple in Korean Daily Life

First, let's look at **Paris Baguette**, a legendary bakery chain easily found across Korea. Established in 1988, it now boasts over 1,000 stores nationwide, catering to Koreans' daily bread and snack needs. Despite being a franchise, each store offers subtle variations in taste and ambiance, making it unique. With a diverse range of fresh breads, cakes, and sandwiches, Paris Baguette has become an integral part of Korean daily life.

## 🥯 London Bagel Museum: The Holy Grail of Bagels with a Queue

Next up is the **London Bagel Museum**, a hot spot that has taken Korea by storm in recent years. Opened in 2021, this trendy bagel cafe has rapidly expanded to six locations, gaining immense popularity. Its most notable feature is the incredibly long wait times. On weekends, people queue for hours just to get a taste. Beyond being a mere bagel shop, London Bagel Museum has become a cultural phenomenon among the MZ generation, thanks to its unique interior design and emotional branding.
