## Paris Baguette: A Korean Bakery Giant, Not French

When you hear the name **Paris Baguette**, you might think it's a charming French bakery chain. Surprise—it's 100% Korean! Founded in 1988 by the SPC Group, Paris Baguette has grown into one of the largest bakery chains in the world, with over 4,000 stores across Korea, the U.S., France, and beyond. Despite its French-sounding name and European-inspired branding, Paris Baguette is deeply rooted in Korean culture and business innovation.

The name "Paris Baguette" was strategically chosen to evoke the sophistication and romance associated with French baking. This clever branding helped the chain stand out in Korea's competitive bakery market and appeal to consumers who admired European culinary traditions. Today, Paris Baguette is a household name in Korea, offering everything from croissants and cakes to sandwiches and coffee—all with a distinctly Korean twist.
