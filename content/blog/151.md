Seoul is a city of glass and steel, but nestled between the skyscrapers are pockets of ancient silence. The **Temples of Seoul** offer a profound contrast to the "Pali-Pali" (Hurry-Hurry) culture of the capital. These are not just religious sites; they are cultural sanctuaries where anyone, regardless of faith, can find peace and a deeper connection to Korean history.

### 1. Jogyesa: The Heart of Korean Buddhism
Located in the center of Insadong, **Jogyesa** is the headquarters of the Jogye Order. It is famous for its colorful lanterns—especially during Buddha’s Birthday—and its massive, ancient lacebark pine tree. Despite being surrounded by modern offices, the smell of incense and the sound of chanting create an instant sense of calm.

### 2. Bongeunsa: Tradition Meets Gangnam Style
Directly across from the COEX Mall in the heart of Gangnam lies **Bongeunsa**. Established in 794 AD, this temple is home to one of the tallest Buddha statues in Korea. Walking through its grounds while seeing the Lotte World Tower in the distance is a visual representation of Korea's "Old Meets New" philosophy.

### 3. Jinguansa: Healing through Food and Nature
Located on the edge of Bukhansan National Park, **Jinguansa** is world-famous for its **Temple Food**. It’s a place where food is treated as medicine and a form of meditation. Many travelers come here for a "Temple Stay," a program where you can sleep at the temple, wake up at 4 AM for morning chants, and learn the art of Zen.
