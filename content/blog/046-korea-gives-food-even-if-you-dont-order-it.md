# Unveiling the Generous Dining Culture of Korean Restaurants

Here, there are people who look confused when their food comes out at a Korean restaurant. 

It looks like the food they `didn't order` was served. 

They just laugh as if they don't know what's going on.

### Korean Food Culture

Actually, it wasn't that they ordered wrong, it was that they didn't know much about Korean food culture. Koreans usually eat rice, soup, and `several side dishes` together for one meal. The same goes for restaurants.

### Side Dishes

If you order a main menu, basic side dishes are also provided. 

You can think of it as a set. 


<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 1rem; margin: 3rem 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">

</div>


Even basic side dishes can be added indefinitely.

### Free Services

And you don't have to pay for `water`; it's `free`. 

Of course, no need to tip the server. At Korean restaurants, just enjoy the food.
