# Unveiling the Generous Dining Culture of Korean Restaurants

Here, there are people who look confused when their food comes out at a Korean restaurant. 

It looks like the food they `didn't order` was served. 

They just laugh as if they don't know what's going on.

### Korean Food Culture

Actually, it wasn't that they ordered wrong, it was that they didn't know much about Korean food culture. Koreans usually eat rice, soup, and `several side dishes` together for one meal. The same goes for restaurants.
