# Korea Travel Must-Buy Items

### Red Ginseng

Red ginseng is a healthy food that is effective in improving immunity. It can be purchased in various forms, including jelly and drinkable essence. It tastes bitter, though. Since it is good for one’s health, it would make a `great gift`.

### Stamp

In Korea, when you prove yourself, you not only sign, but you also stamp. You can quickly create stamps with `various designs`. Engrave your name or favorite letters and use them in various ways.

### Soju

Do you know the K-alcohol “soju”? Soju is Korea's representative `alcohol` with an alcohol content of about 17 percent. They are also sold in packs, so you can take them with you on the plane.

### Mask Pack

Korea, a beauty powerhouse. You’ve probably heard of K-beauty. Among the many beauty products, I recommend Korean mask packs because they are inexpensive, come in many varieties, and are functional. Regardless of gender, lots of people use one `pack a day` for skin care, so you should buy it too.
