In most countries, a "Dollar Store" is a place for cheap, low-quality items. In South Korea, **Daiso** is a lifestyle destination. With most items priced between 1,000 KRW ($0.75) and 5,000 KRW ($3.70), it has become the go-to spot for everything from kitchenware to high-tech skincare.

### 1. The K-Beauty Revolution at Daiso
The biggest trend in 2024-25 is **Daiso Beauty**. Major Korean skincare brands have launched exclusive "Daiso lines" that feature the same active ingredients as luxury products but at a fraction of the cost. Items like the "VT Reedle Shot" at Daiso have become so popular that they sell out in minutes every morning.

Daiso has also tapped into Korea's love for camping and DIY. You can find professional-grade camping gear, stationery, and home organization tools that are both aesthetic and functional. It’s the ultimate place for "Life Hacks."
