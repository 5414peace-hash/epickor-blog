For many travelers, the quality of public restrooms can make or break a trip. In South Korea, however, the "toilet experience" is often a highlight. From high-tech heated seats in subway stations to the surprising cleanliness of mountain hiking trails, Korea has turned public hygiene into a national pride. 

### 1. The High-Tech Revolution: Heated Seats and Music
The most striking feature of a Korean restroom is the **Bidet**. These aren't just simple water sprays; they are sophisticated machines with heated seats (a lifesaver in winter), adjustable water temperature, air dryers, and even "Etiquette Bells" that play the sound of running water or music to ensure privacy.

### 2. The "No Trash Can" Policy
You might notice a sign saying "Please flush the paper in the toilet." Historically, Korea used trash cans for toilet paper due to old plumbing. However, since 2018, the government implemented a "No Trash Can" policy to improve hygiene and eliminate odors. The toilet paper provided is designed to dissolve quickly, so don't be afraid to flush!

### 3. Free and Everywhere
Unlike many European cities where you must pay 50 cents or a Euro, public toilets in Korea are **100% free**. You can find them in every subway station, park, and even in most small buildings. They are meticulously maintained by dedicated staff, ensuring a safe and pleasant environment for everyone.

### FAQ: Survival Tips
**Q: Where can I find a toilet in an emergency?**
A: Head to the nearest subway station. They are always free and clean. Alternatively, look for the "Open Toilet" (개방화장실) signs on buildings.
**Q: Is there always toilet paper?**
A: 99% of the time, yes. But in very old buildings or traditional markets, it's a good idea to carry a small pack of tissues just in case.
