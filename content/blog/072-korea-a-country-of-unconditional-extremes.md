# Discover Korea’s Love for Extremes in Food, Spice, and Sports

### Extreme Love for Hot and Cold Food

Korean people are quite unique in their tastes. 

They're crazy about extremely hot soup, not just warm. Boiling soup in a ceramic bowl called *ttukbaegi* is served so hot that it’s bubbling, and they scoop it up with a stainless steel spoon, enjoying every sip.

On the other hand, they are equally passionate about cold dishes. One popular example is `*naengmyeon*`, served in a large stainless steel bowl with frozen broth that’s so cold it feels like your head might burst. This love for extremes is deeply rooted in Korean food culture.

### The Ultimate Spicy Challenge

You may know that dishes like `*kimchi*` and `*tteokbokki*` are spicy, but in Korea, there’s a level of spiciness that goes beyond what most people can handle. Take `*Buldak Bokkeum Myeon*` (fire chicken noodles), for example—it’s so spicy, it has even sent people to the hospital! Various tteokbokki brands also offer sauces with spice levels that are truly extreme, pushing your taste buds to the limit. If you’re thinking of trying them for fun, be careful—one bite could ruin your entire trip!

### Archery: Where Precision Meets Extremes

Korea’s love for extremes extends beyond food into sports. `Archery`, an Olympic event, is one of the most precision-demanding sports, and in Korea, the competition is fierce. There's a saying that the Korean national team trials are as intense as an Olympic final. The athletes undergo intense training, which includes practicing against noise at baseball stadiums and even competing with archery robots to sharpen their skills. Koreans, it seems, don’t know how to do anything halfway!
