If you think a haircut is just a haircut, you haven't been to a **Korean Hair Salon**. In Seoul, getting your hair done is a therapeutic, high-tech experience that focuses on "Customization" and "Service." From the famous "Head Spa" to the precision of the cut, K-Beauty starts at the scalp.

### 1. The Consultation: Finding Your 'Life Hair'
A Korean stylist won't just ask "What do you want?" They will analyze your face shape, hair texture, and even your "Personal Color" to recommend a style that fits you perfectly. This is often referred to as finding your **"Life Hair" (Insaeng-meori)**—the one style that defines you.

### 2. The Scalp Scaling and Head Spa
The secret to the "Korean Shine" is scalp health. Almost every service includes a deep scalp massage and "scaling" to remove impurities. Some specialized salons offer 60-minute "Head Spas" with steam, aromatherapy, and water-massage tools that will put you into a deep state of relaxation.

### 3. The 'Service' Culture
In a Korean salon, you are treated like a VIP. You'll be offered free iced Americanos, snacks, and even hand massages while your hair is processing. The attention to detail is insane—even the way they wash your hair involves a specific technique to ensure not a single drop of water hits your face.

### FAQ: Booking Tips
