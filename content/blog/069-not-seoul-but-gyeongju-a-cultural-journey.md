# Explore the "Museum Without Walls"

## – Gyeongju's Rich Heritage and Hidden Gems

Have you heard of the city of Gyeongju in Korea? 

It’s often called the "`museum without walls.`" 

Everywhere you go, you’ll encounter cultural heritage sites.

### Architectural Beauty

At night, "`Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond`" shines even brighter, while "`Cheomseongdae`" stands firm both day and night. You definitely need to see the `Bulguksa` Temple and `Seokguram Grotto`, which showcase Korea's exceptional architectural beauty.

### Modern Delights

Don't forget to spend some time on `Hwangridan-gil`, where you'll find popular restaurants, cafes, and shops that MZers love.

### Travel Tips

Traveling from Seoul to Gyeongju takes about 2.5 to 3 hours by KTX, 3.5 to 4 hours by express bus, or around 4 hours by car.

### Unique Experience

Although it's a bit far from the Seoul metropolitan area, including Incheon International Airport, staying in a traditional Korean hanok can make for a unique experience, whether it's for a night or a few days.
