### Food That’s Worth the Ticket

A huge part of the experience is the `food`. Forget boring concession snacks—Korean stadiums offer a feast of options. Crispy `fried chicken` paired with `ice-cold beer` is a fan favorite, but you’ll also find traditional Korean dishes like spicy tteokbokki and savory gimbap.

The best part? You can enjoy these culinary delights right from your seat while cheering for your favorite team. It’s not just a game; it’s dinner and a show!

### Entertainment Between Innings

In Korean baseball, the fun doesn’t stop when the players leave the field. The seventh-inning stretch transforms into a `mini-festival`. Cheerleaders take the stage with choreographed performances that get the crowd moving, and on special occasions, K-pop idols make surprise appearances.

It’s like getting a concert and a game in one ticket. No wonder fans eagerly wait for these mid-game spectacles as much as the action on the field!
