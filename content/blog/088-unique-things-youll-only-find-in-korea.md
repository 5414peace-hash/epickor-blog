### High-Tech Subway System
Korea’s subway system is one of the best in the world. Imagine riding a train that offers free WiFi, powerful air conditioning during scorching summers, and heated seats in the freezing winters. Yes, Korea's subway isn’t just a mode of transportation; it’s a haven of comfort for commuters. The stations are also incredibly clean and user-friendly, with clear signs in multiple languages.

### The “Culture of Trust”
What truly sets Korea apart, though, is its profound "culture of trust." Outside convenience stores, you might see stacks of products sitting unattended, yet no one takes anything that doesn’t belong to them. On public transportation, people regularly give up their seats to the elderly. Strangers will even stop to help others carry heavy bags. This unique social fabric is woven with mutual respect, integrity, and an unwavering sense of community.
