## Do You Know the Korean Singing Legends 'Kim Na Park Lee'?

This term refers to four iconic singers:

- **Beomsu Kim**
- **Naul**
- **Hyo Shin Park**
- **Leesu**

These four legendary singers are collectively known as ‘Kim Na Park Lee.’

### Karaoke in Korea

I don't know why, but there are about 30,000 karaoke rooms in Korea. 

Korea's population is 50 million. 

There are over 54,000 convenience stores, 

30,000 chicken restaurants, 

15,000 billiard rooms, 

and 9,000 PC rooms.

But there are 30,000 karaoke rooms.

### Social Culture

Is it because there is a culture in Korea where friends and co-workers who are awkward with each other drink a lot to break the awkwardness and go to karaoke rooms and sing their favorite songs together to become friends?

### Nationwide Singing Competitions

Or is it because of Korea's longest-running program, 'Nation Singing Contest,' which has been touring the entire country for over 40 years?

### Love for Singing

As can be seen in 'Superstar K', a competition between ordinary people who risk their lives through singing, Koreans really love to sing.

### Future Content Tease

If the response is good, in the next episode, I'll let you know good songs to sing in karaoke with Koreans.
