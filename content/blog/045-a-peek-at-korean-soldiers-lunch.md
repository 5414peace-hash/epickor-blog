### Lunch During Training

Today, I'm going to show you what kind of lunch the reservists eat when they go to training.

First, it came in the form of a lunch box. 

There is a huge amount of rice. 

Does this mean eat and cheer up?

### Korean Meal

As expected from a Korean meal, there were several side dishes and pork cutlet was served as the main menu. 

Just sprinkle the sauce and eat it. 

Finish with apple juice.

### After Lunch

Once they've finished eating, start training even if the weather is bad! 

After training, they take the bus back home.
