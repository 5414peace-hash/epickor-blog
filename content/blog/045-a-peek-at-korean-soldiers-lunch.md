# Discover What Korean Reservists Eat During Training

All young Korean men go to the `military`.

### Reserve Force Training

After they are discharged from the military, they become a reserve force. They are one of the people who have to pick up a gun again when there is a war.

### Training Duration

The reserve force period is a total of `8 years`. For the first four years, they train for 3 days and 2 nights every year. For the next two years, training is held twice a year. For the last two years, training is conducted exclusively over the phone.

### Lunch During Training

Today, I'm going to show you what kind of lunch the reservists eat when they go to training.

First, it came in the form of a lunch box. 

There is a huge amount of rice. 

Does this mean eat and cheer up?

### Korean Meal

As expected from a Korean meal, there were several side dishes and pork cutlet was served as the main menu.

Just sprinkle the sauce and eat it. 

Finish with apple juice.

### After Lunch

Once they've finished eating, start training even if the weather is bad! 

After training, they take the bus back home.
