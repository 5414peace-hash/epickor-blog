# Explore Korea's Hidden Underground Shopping Gems

### 1. COEX Mall at Samseong Station

What's even more amazing than Korea’s vibrant night streets is the vast underground shopping areas. `COEX Mall,` located beneath Samseong Station on `Subway Line 2`, is one such place. 

Even with a map, it's easy to lose your way in this enormous mall. Since its 2014 renovation, which introduced sleek white tones, the number of people getting lost has surged. 

With everything from movie theaters to restaurants, clothing stores, and accessory shops, COEX Mall offers a complete experience, making it unnecessary to leave. That said, navigating your way out can be quite the challenge!

### 2. Gangnam Station Underground Shopping Mall

Gangnam Station on `Subway Line 2` is not only known for its bustling streets but also for its underground shopping mall. It's perfect for those looking to do some light shopping, with a wide range of clothing stores and accessory shops available.
