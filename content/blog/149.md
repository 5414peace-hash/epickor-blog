When the first raindrops hit the pavement in Seoul, thousands of people simultaneously think of one thing: **Makgeolli and Pajeon**. This pairing is the ultimate comfort food for a rainy day in Korea, rooted in ancient farming traditions and the soothing sounds of the storm.

### 1. The Sizzling Sound of Rain
Why Pajeon (Green Onion Pancake)? Koreans say the sound of the pancake sizzling on the griddle mimics the sound of raindrops falling. This psychological connection makes the crispy, oily pancake irresistible when it's pouring outside.

### 2. Makgeolli: The People's Wine
Makgeolli is Korea's oldest alcohol—a milky, sparkling rice wine that is rich in probiotics and vitamins. Historically, it was the drink of the farmers. Because it’s filling and low in alcohol (around 6%), it provided the perfect energy boost during a hard day’s work in the rice fields.

### 3. The Ritual of the Brass Bowl
Makgeolli is traditionally served in a large kettle and poured into shallow **brass or tin bowls**. There is something incredibly communal and grounded about clinking these metal bowls together while the rain drums on the roof of a traditional 'Pocha' (street pub).

### FAQ: Tasting Guide
**Q: Should I shake the bottle?**
A: Yes! The sediment at the bottom contains all the flavor and nutrients. Turn the bottle upside down and give it a gentle swirl before opening (be careful of the carbonation!).
**Q: What are the best varieties?**
A: Look for **Aspartame-free** varieties for a cleaner taste. Flavored versions like Chestnut (Bam) or Honey are great for beginners.
