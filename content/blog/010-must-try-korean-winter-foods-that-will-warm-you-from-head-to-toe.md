# **Warm Up with Korea’s Winter Foods!**
### 🥞 Street Food: Hotteok & Bungeoppang

**Hotteok**, the syrup-filled pancake, is a `sweet, crispy snack` that warms your hands and your heart. Filled with brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped nuts, this golden delight is a nostalgic treat that Koreans have loved for generations.
Then there’s **bungeoppang**, a fish-shaped pastry stuffed with `red bean or custard`. It's a go-to snack for cold days, often sold piping hot in twos or threes at market stalls, subway stations, or school corners.
These snacks are more than food—they’re part of Korea’s winter identity. Just the smell of hotteok sizzling on the griddle can bring back childhood memories for many.
### 🌶️ Tteokbokki & Eomuk: Spicy Street Comfort
If you crave bold flavors, **tteokbokki** and **eomuk** are a perfect combo to try in winter.
Tteokbokki features chewy rice cakes simmered in a spicy, sweet, and savory `gochujang-based` sauce. It’s often mixed with fish cake slices, boiled eggs, or cheese for an extra kick.
Next to it, you’ll usually find skewers of **eomuk** (`fish cake`) bobbing in hot anchovy broth. Grab a cup and help yourself—it’s usually free and unlimited. This simple, salty soup is the perfect way to stay warm while enjoying your street feast.

The pairing of spicy and soothing makes these two snacks the ultimate winter comfort food combo. They’re especially popular at night markets and street tents (*pojangmacha*) across the country.
### 🍲 Soul Food: Samgyetang & Kimchi Jjigae
Korean winter food isn’t just about snacking—there are also hearty meals made to nourish and warm you from within.
**Samgyetang**, or `ginseng chicken soup`, is a traditional dish made with a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice, garlic, jujube, and ginseng. It’s believed to strengthen the body and boost immunity during the cold months.
Another favorite is **kimchi jjigae**, a spicy stew made with aged kimchi, tofu, pork belly, and scallions. It’s deeply flavorful and often served still bubbling in a hot stone pot. Locals love eating it with a bowl of rice on the side, perfect for chilly days.

Both dishes are winter staples in Korean households, offering a heartwarming balance of spice and nutrition.
### 🍠 Market Snacks: Chestnuts & Sweet Potatoes
One of the coziest winter moments in Korea comes from strolling through a traditional market with a paper bag of hot snacks in hand.
**Roasted chestnuts (gunbam)** and **charcoal-baked sweet potatoes (gungoguma)** are simple yet satisfying winter treats. The chestnuts are soft and nutty, while the sweet potatoes are caramelized on the outside and buttery on the inside.
Vendors prepare them over hot coals, wrapping them in paper to keep them warm. The aroma of these roasted snacks fills the air in markets all over Korea—especially in places like Gwangjang Market or Namdaemun.
Perfect for nibbling as you walk, these snacks offer a sweet, natural alternative to the spicy flavors of tteokbokki and kimchi jjigae.
