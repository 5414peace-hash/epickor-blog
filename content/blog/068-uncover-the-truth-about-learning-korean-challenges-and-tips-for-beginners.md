# Is Korean Difficult to Learn?

**Hangul**, the Korean alphabet, was invented in 1443 by `King Sejong` the Great. 

It’s incredibly logical, with just 24 letters, making it one of the easiest alphabets to learn. 

You can master it in just a few hours!

### Grammar Differences

**Grammar** in Korean is quite different from English. 

For example, in English, you say “I eat pizza,” but in Korean, it’s “I pizza eat” (나는 피자를 먹는다). 

Additionally, there are honorifics—different ways of speaking depending on who you're talking to, adding another layer of complexity.
