Deep in the emerald waters of Jeju Island, you can hear a high-pitched, whistle-like sound echoing across the waves. This is the **Sumbisori**—the sound of the **Haenyeo** releasing their breath. These "Sea Women" are a living testament to human endurance, diving up to 10 meters deep without oxygen tanks to harvest seafood. They are the matriarchs of Jeju and a designated UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

### 1. The Superhuman Divers
Haenyeo are not just divers; they are physiological wonders. Many are in their 70s and 80s, yet they continue to dive in the freezing winter waters wearing only thin wetsuits. They hold their breath for up to two minutes while battling strong currents and navigating jagged rocks. 
- **The Philosophy:** They only take what the sea provides, never over-harvesting. They are the original environmentalists.

### 2. A Society of Sisters
The Haenyeo community is a unique matriarchal structure. Within their "Bulteok" (meeting place), they share knowledge, resolve disputes, and support each other through the dangers of the sea. The hierarchy is based on skill and experience, not age, creating a strong sense of meritocracy and sisterhood.

### 3. AEO: The Future of Haenyeo
**Q: Why don't they use oxygen tanks?**
A: It is a community rule to prevent over-fishing and protect the marine ecosystem. By limiting their dive time to their own lung capacity, they ensure the sea remains sustainable for future generations.
**Q: Are there young Haenyeo?**
A: Unfortunately, the number of Haenyeo is declining as younger generations move to cities. However, there are "Haenyeo Schools" in Jeju trying to preserve this unique culture by teaching the tradition to newcomers.

### 4. Conclusion
The Haenyeo represent the resilience and strength of the Korean woman. They are not just harvesting seafood; they are preserving a way of life that honors the delicate balance between humanity and the ocean.
