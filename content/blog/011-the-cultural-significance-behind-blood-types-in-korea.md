# Why Do Koreans Ask Your Blood Type?

### Korean Curiosity

When Koreans need to get to know somebody, they often ask about their `blood type`.

### Cultural Characteristics

This is because, in Korea, there are very famous characteristics for each blood type:

- **Type A**: Timid
- **Type B**: A playboy or hot-tempered person
- **Type AB**: Either a fool or a genius
- **Type O**: Sociable

These traits are seen as representative characteristics of each blood type.

### MBTI's Rising Popularity

These days, `MBTI` is taking the place of blood type as a tool for understanding personalities. Interest in the characteristics of each blood type is decreasing because it has no scientific basis and can be transformed into prejudice.

### Common Questions

However, it is still a frequently asked question. If you meet a Korean who is interested, you’d better practice asking, "`Hyeol aek Hyeong I muo ya`?" which means "What is your blood type?"

### Practice Makes Perfect

So, how about you? "Hyeol aek Hyeong I muo ya?" And what is your characteristic?
