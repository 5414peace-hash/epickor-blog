### MBTI's Rising Popularity

These days, `MBTI` is taking the place of blood type as a tool for understanding personalities. Interest in the characteristics of each blood type is decreasing because it has no scientific basis and can be transformed into prejudice.

### Common Questions

However, it is still a frequently asked question. If you meet a Korean who is interested, you’d better practice asking, "`Hyeol aek Hyeong I muo ya`?" which means "What is your blood type?"

### Practice Makes Perfect

So, how about you? "Hyeol aek Hyeong I muo ya?" And what is your characteristic?
