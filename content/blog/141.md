Running has become the hottest social activity in Seoul. What used to be a solo workout is now a high-fashion, collective "crew" culture. However, the massive popularity of **Han River Running** has recently led to new regulations aimed at keeping the peace for all park users.

### 1. The Rise of the Running Crew
Young Koreans have embraced "Running Crews" as a new way to socialize without alcohol. These crews often number in the dozens, wearing coordinated high-end gear and taking professional-quality photos for Instagram. The phrase "Work Hard, Run Hard" has become a mantra for Seoul's office workers.

### 2. The Controversy: The "Group of 5" Ban
The trend became so intense that some districts, like Seocho, implemented a recommendation to avoid running in groups of 5 or more. 
- **The Reason:** Large crews were taking up the entire width of the track, shouting chants, and blocking other citizens. 
- **The "Photo Trap":** Crews would often stop mid-track to take group photos, causing congestion and accidents with cyclists.

### 3. Why Night Running is King
Seoul's summer days are too humid, so the city truly comes alive at night. "Night Running" allows you to enjoy the cool river breeze and the stunning LED-lit bridges. It’s a safe, meditative experience that offers a unique perspective on the city's skyline.

### FAQ: Runner's Guide
**Q: Do I need to join a crew to run?**
A: Not at all! Most people run solo or in pairs. Just follow the "Keep to the Right" rule.
**Q: Are there water fountains?**
A: Yes, Han River parks have frequent water fountains and convenience stores (where you can get the famous Han River Ramen after your run!).
