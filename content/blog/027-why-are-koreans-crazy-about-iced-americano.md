And the undisputed number one best-selling drink in many cafes is Iced Americano. 

Why on earth are Koreans so crazy about “iced” Americano?

Actually, there are many guesses. When Koreans get angry, they drink iced Americano to cool off their anger.

This is because coffee is not considered a beverage to be consumed like tea.
