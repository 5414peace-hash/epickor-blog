**Innovative Use of Ladder Trucks**

Korea, with its small land area and dense population, has more apartments than houses. 

Koreans, known for their intolerance of slowness and high emphasis on efficiency, adopted ladder trucks, originally special construction equipment, for moving purposes.

### Modern Changes

**Reduced Usage**

These days, the use of ladder trucks has decreased. New apartments often have separate freight elevators and glass railings, making it difficult to use ladder trucks. Moreover, moving to floors higher than the 10th floor can be dangerous if it's windy.

### Traditional Practices

**Continued Use in Older Apartments**

In older apartments, old elevators are prone to breaking down due to the weight of moving items. Thus, `ladder trucks` are still actively recommended to prevent such issues.

**Special Moving Cultures**

Is there a special moving culture in your country as well?
