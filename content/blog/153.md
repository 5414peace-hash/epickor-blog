If you see a long line of tourists and office workers in front of a tiny red booth in Myeongdong, you’ve found **Isaac Toast**. It is the "Soul Food" of Korean breakfast. What started as a small street stall has become a global franchise, and the secret lies in a single, legendary "Magic Sauce" that changed the way Koreans eat sandwiches.

### 1. The Magic Sauce: A Sweet and Salty Mystery
The core of Isaac Toast’s success is its sauce. It’s a sweet, kiwi-infused spread that creates a perfect "Dan-jjan" (Sweet-Salty) harmony when paired with savory ham, melted cheese, and a fluffy omelet filled with corn. This sauce was developed by the founder, Mrs. Kim, and remains a closely guarded secret.
