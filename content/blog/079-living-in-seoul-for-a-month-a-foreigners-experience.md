Seoul's public transportation is a standout feature for expats. 

Tim from the UK found the subway system incredibly `convenient`, allowing him to explore the city with ease, even without a car. While Tokyo also boasts a great network, he highlighted Seoul’s as more user-friendly, especially for non-native speakers. The signage in English and intuitive navigation made commuting stress-free.

### **Cons of Living in Seoul**

### **1. Language Barriers**

While Seoul is modern and welcoming, the language barrier can be daunting for those who don’t speak Korean. Everyday tasks like ordering food or navigating administrative systems can become challenging without basic Korean phrases or apps to assist.

### **2. Cultural Adjustments**

Adapting to Korean culture may come with surprises. Social norms such as respecting elders, using honorifics, and specific dining etiquette can feel overwhelming initially. However, many foreigners find these differences enriching once they adjust.

### **3. Cost of Living**

Living in trendy neighborhoods like Gangnam or Itaewon can strain your budget. Rent and dining prices in these areas often rival those in other global metropolises. While there are affordable options elsewhere, adjusting to Seoul's economy requires thoughtful planning.
