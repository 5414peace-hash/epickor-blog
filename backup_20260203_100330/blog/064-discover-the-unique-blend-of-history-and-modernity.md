# Not Seoul, but Suwon

In Korea, there is a city called `Suwon`, which you can get to from Seoul in about an hour by subway or just `20 minutes` by train.

### Historic Hwaseong Fortress

This city has a cool old fortress called `Hwaseong`, and an area called `Haenggung-dong` is set up around it. Just like the trendy spots in Seoul, Haenggung-dong is packed with cozy cafes and restaurants, perfect for chilling out. Plus, it's a great area for a stroll along the fortress wall.

### Evening Walks

Walking along the fortress wall in the evening is especially nice because you get to enjoy the `night view` of downtown Suwon.

### Famous Wang Galbi

Suwon is famous for its 'Wang Galbi', which are these amazingly marinated ribs. It’s soaked in a special marinade for two days so the flavor really sinks in, and then it’s grilled to perfection. The Wang Galbi in Suwon is known for its sweet taste, so definitely give it a try if you visit.

### Starfield Shopping Mall

On top of that, a huge shopping mall called `Starfield` just opened in Suwon.
