# Why Are Koreans Crazy About Garlic

### The Love for Garlic in Korea

BBC MasterChef's main host, `John Torode`, once remarked that he ate more `garlic` during his visit to Korea than he had in his entire life. 

He even showed a handful of garlic, explaining that what Koreans consider "a little" is actually quite a lot.

### Garlic Consumption

In fact, Korean per capita annual garlic consumption ranks first in the world. This country even cultivates “elephant garlic,” which is 10 times larger than regular garlic.

According to a famous Korean myth, a long time ago, a god from the sky descended to the human world. A bear and a tiger asked this god to make them human. The god told them they could become human if they survived 100 days in a cave eating only mugwort and garlic. Only the bear succeeded and became human.

### Dangun: The Garlic Connection

The bear-turned-human married the god and had a son, `Dangun`, who is considered the ancestor of Koreans. Thus, the joke is that Koreans started as a people of garlic from the very beginning with Dangun.
