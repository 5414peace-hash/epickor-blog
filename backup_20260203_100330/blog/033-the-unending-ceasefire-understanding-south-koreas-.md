# Country at War Without End - South Korea

### The Korean War's Unfinished Business

**Do you know that Korea is technically still under a ceasefire, not a peace treaty?** 

In 1953, the Korean War didn't conclude with a peace treaty but rather a temporary halt. Interestingly, Korea was excluded from the armistice agreement back then.

### Decades of Tension

Fast forward to 2024, over 50 years have elapsed since then. North Korea has continued to launch missiles into the West and East Seas, no matter `where the money came from`.

### A Nation Unfazed

However, it's foreign media that tends to be surprised by North Korea's missile launches. 

For Koreans, it's hardly a cause for concern. 

Over 91% of Korean adult males have served in the military for at least two years. 

Even after discharge, many undergo periodic military training, leading to a national insensitivity to security.

### Political Timing

When North Korea is mentioned, it signals the approaching election season. 

Ordinarily, Koreans aren't overly bothered by North Korea's actions. Yet, as National Assembly or Presidential elections near, politicians often bring up 'North Korea.'

### Everyday Safety

`So, is Korea safe?` 

At midnight, a woman can walk to the convenience store alone and buy milk. 

### Peace.
