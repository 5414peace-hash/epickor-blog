# 5 Korean Snacks You MUST Try

Your life will be divided into before and after when you eat these `snacks`.

Even those who like snacks and those who don't like snacks can't stop eating.

This is not a taste test for you.

`Just eat it.`

### French Pie

It's not made in France, but it tastes better than French snacks. There are apple, strawberry, and chocolate cream flavors. The taste of rich jam with crispy biscuits is a delight. They are individually wrapped, making them great as `gifts`.

### Whale Rice (Goraebab)

These are snacks in the shape of sea creatures that whales would eat, and they have a mysterious yet addictive scent and taste of seafood that cannot be explained in text. But once you taste it, you'll be nodding your head as to why this snack is called Whale Rice. A similar type of snack is `Crab Chips`.

It looks like a cream puff, but it has `chocolate` inside and melts in your mouth. There is a huge fan base in Korea, and although it is a snack, it does not make any sound when eaten.

### Mother Hand Pie

It’s the taste of savory yet crunchy `homemade cookies`. The name seems to mean that it would have tasted like this if mom made it. It's even better when eaten with coffee.

### Choco Heim

The high-quality wafers are filled with `hazelnuts and chocolate cream`. If you put it in the freezer and eat it, the chocolate will freeze and taste even better.
