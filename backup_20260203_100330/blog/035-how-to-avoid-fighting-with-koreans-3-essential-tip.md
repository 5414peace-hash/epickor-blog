# Mastering Korean Etiquette

## Tips to Prevent Conflicts with Koreans

### Driving Etiquette

**First, think of honking as an accessory when driving.**

Unlike the streets of Southeast Asia, in Korea, `honking` is generally avoided when driving. Honking means `you are driving poorly`. A Korean who knows that the person in question is them will get out of the car immediately. Especially if you honk a horn in Busan, then get `ready to fight`.

### Sensitive Jokes

**Second, mom jokes should only be made between siblings.**

Korea values courtesy highly, and Koreans hold their parents in high regard. 

What if you make mom jokes to these Koreans? 

No matter how many years you've been friends with that Korean, you might find a fist flying towards your face. 

But, the `exception` is if a fight has already occurred. There are so many different mom swear words in Korea that you can't even imagine.

### Dokdo Issue

**Third, memorize the answer to "What about Dokdo?"**

`Dokdo` is an island situated in the easternmost part of Korea, `inhabited` by Koreans, and `patrolled` by Korean police. If someone asks about a territorial dispute over Dokdo, respond with: "There's no such thing."

By following these three guidelines, you can avoid fights with Koreans.
