### F(x) – Hot Summer

`Released in 2011.` 

Although the song is 13 years old, it is still a highly addictive song that ranks first in Koreans' summer playlists. All five of F(x) were great, but especially Krystal and Sulli at this time were all women's wannabes.

### SISTAR – Touch My Body

There's probably no Korean who doesn't know this song by SISTAR, the ultimate summer idol group. Even if it came out today, it would still be a chart-topper.
