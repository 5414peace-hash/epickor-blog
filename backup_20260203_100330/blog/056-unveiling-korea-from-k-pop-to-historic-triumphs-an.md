# Beyond The Kimchi Journey

How did you learn about the country called Korea? 

BTS? 

PSY’s Gangnam Style? 

Son Heung-min? 

Kimchi? 

Or something else?

### New Perspective

Whatever it is, forget about Korea as you know it so far. 

Korea is more `fun`, `exciting`, and `thrilling` than you thought. 

It’s also `sad`, `depressing`, and `heartbreaking`.

### Rich History

With a history of 5,000 years as one nation, Korea, which was in ruins after the Korean War in the 1950s, developed at a tremendous pace and rose to the ranks of economic powers. Korea's music and film content industry has achieved remarkable success since the 2000s.

### Korean People

At the center of all of this are Koreans. But behind the success of this remarkable country, there are also great sorrows.
