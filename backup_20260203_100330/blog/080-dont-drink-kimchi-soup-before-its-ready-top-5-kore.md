### 1. **Don’t Drink Kimchi Soup Before It’s Ready**

**Translated Content**:

This Korean saying, `"김치국부터 마시지 마라,"` is a reminder not to get ahead of yourself. It parallels the English proverb, "Don’t count your chickens before they hatch." Just as you wouldn’t drink unready kimchi soup, this wisdom tells us to wait for the right time and not assume outcomes prematurely. Patience is key in life, especially when it comes to success and planning.

### 2. **Even a Tiger Appears When Spoken Of**

**Translated Content**:

The Korean proverb `"호랑이도 제 말 하면 온다"` is similar to the English saying, "Speak of the devil, and he shall appear." It humorously highlights how talking about someone can magically make them show up.

### 3. **It’s Darkest Under the Lamp**

It’s a profound metaphor for appreciating what’s nearby, whether it’s opportunities, people, or small blessings in daily life.
