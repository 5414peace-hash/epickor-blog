# How advanced is automation in Korea?

### Ramen Machines

You probably already know that Korea is famous for ramen like Shin Ramyun and Buldak. 

But have you ever seen a `machine that makes ramen`? They say the ramen made by this machine tastes even better than the one made by people.

If you're traveling to Korea, head over to a convenience store in Hangang Park right away. 

Any park along the Han River, whether in Gangnam or Gangbuk, will do because there's always a convenience store nearby. 

This ramen-making machine simply opens a regular bag of ramen, adds the soup, and `automatically` does everything from adjusting the amount of water to boiling and stopping. All you have to do is stir it gently with chopsticks in between.

If you ever go to a gas station in Korea, be sure to check out the automatic `car wash machine`. 

Just put your car in neutral, sit back, and watch as it moves on its own along the rails, automatically doing everything from a soap bubble massage to high-pressure water `washing and final drying`.
